      "FACEBOOK users are being advised to remove phone numbers and addresses from their profiles after the website changed its terms to allow third parties to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m private contact details.The \u001b[43mnetwork\u001b[0m announced a shift in its developer terms on its blog, saying: \"We are now making a user's address and mobile phone number accessible [to developers].\"This means that whenever a \u001b[43muser\u001b[0m accepts the terms and conditions of downloading an application, such as a game or video, they will also allow that company to see their mobile telephone number and address, if they have previously added that \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m to their profile. The move prompted criticism from \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m experts who advised people to remove private \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m from the site. Recently, \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m was hit by fake applications which post spam links on users' walls and those of their friends.\"Users will need to give permission for third-party \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m applications to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m this data,\" explained Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at IT \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m and control firm Sophos. \"But it still sounds like a recipe for disaster, given the prevalence of rogue scam applications already on \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m - all of which benefit from apparently being blessed by the \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m name and brand.\"According to Sophos, \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m is plagued by rogue applications that exist to bombard users with advertisements, point them to surveys that earn commission, and sometimes trick users into handing over mobile numbers to sign them up for a premium-rate service.The IT \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m company said that rogue developers would now find it easier to gather more \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m from users.\"Facebook told its alleged one million app developers how to ask users for permission to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m this newly liberated \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m late on Friday night, but we already know many users don't bother reading the small print and just click the button without thinking of the consequences,\" said Mr Cluley.\"What they've failed to do is explain how \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m will become more safety-conscious now that it has taken this controversial step.\"Facebook claimed that allowing third parties to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m addresses and phone numbers would make it more efficient and did not pose a \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m risk.\"You need to explicitly choose to \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m your \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m before any app or website can \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m it and no private \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m is shared without your permission,\" said a spokesman.\"As an additional step for this new feature, you're not able to \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m your friends' address or mobile information.\"The website does not vet its developers like Apple does for its App Store, despite the protestations of \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m firms, who have noticed the rise of spam on the site.Last year, \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m simplified its \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m settings in response to international criticism of its increasingly complex system for users to decide which aspects of their \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m is available online.The TelegraphYour \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m is Facebook's most valuable asset telegraph.co.uk/tech\n",

      "GOOGLE is headed for a confrontation with European \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m watchdogs after it defied their orders to reverse sweeping changes to small print across services including search, Gmail and YouTube. The internet giant introduced a new \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m last March that gave it the power to merge \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m from its various websites to create a master profile of each individual's interests, to help target advertising. In October, European regulators, including Britain's Information Commissioner and led by France's CNIL, gave \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m four months to reverse the changes or face legal action. On Monday, they said \"no answer has been given\". The group of regulators, coordinating their response via the EU, pledged to take \"repressive action\" to break the impasse.Google introduced the new \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m despite calls to delay it for regulatory scrutiny, and said yesterday that it believed the data-merging was in line with European \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m laws. \"Our \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m respects European \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m and allows us to create simpler, more effective services,\" a spokesman said. \"We have engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process, and we'll continue to do so.\" Regulators say Google's \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m does not provide its hundreds of millions of visitors with full \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m about how they would be tracked or how that \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m would be used. Those who did not agree to the creation of a master profile were told they would have to stop using \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m services. CNIL will meet its counterparts to discuss their next move on February 26. Each domestic regulator is responsible for applying its own penalties for \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m of \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection law. The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, can impose fines of up to £500,000 and recently handed Sony a £250,000 penalty for a \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m failure that allowed hackers to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m PlayStation gamers' \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m details. EU competition authorities are separately looking at whether \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m abuses its dominance of the general web search market to disadvantage competitors and promote its own specialist services, such as shopping comparison.£500,000 The maximum fine that the UK's Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, can impose on companies\n",

      "ANGELA MERKEL condemned America's \"unacceptable\" behaviour yesterday after \"firm suspicions\" emerged that United States intelligence agencies had monitored her \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m mobile telephone for almost four years. The growing row over US \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m could threaten negotiations on a transatlantic trade deal between the European Union and America if Germany insists on \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m safeguards and \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection guarantees that Barack Obama will have a hard time delivering from Congress. The diplomatic row looked likely only to intensify last night after it emerged that at least 35 world leaders had their communications targeted by the National Security Agency (NSA). Documents leaked to The Guardian by the fugitive whistleblower Edward \u001b[43mSnowden\u001b[0m show that the \u001b[43mspy\u001b[0m agency encouraged other US government departments to hand over their \"rolodexes\" of foreign contacts to be used for targeting. \"In one recent case, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders,\" according to one memo. The 2006 NSA document does not name the 35 leaders and concedes that the telephone numbers yielded \"little reportable intelligence\". The White House refused to address the disclosures, saying: \"We are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations.\" The rift between Washington and Berlin presents a dilemma for David Cameron, who could be forced to choose between his greatest ally, the US, and a German chancellor who is his key partner in attempts to reform the EU. Arriving at a Brussels summit, where Mr Cameron had hoped to strengthen those efforts, Mrs Merkel condemned the US suspected espionage as something that was \"just not done\" between members of the Western alliance. \"It's not just about me but about every German citizen. We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this trust must now be established once again,\" she said. Germany summoned John Emerson, the US ambassador to Berlin, to hear a protest and a demand for full \u001b[43mdisclosure\u001b[0m of the NSA's activities from Guido Westerwelle, Germany's foreign minister. \"I told the ambassador that for Germany it is unacceptable that the mobile phone of our chancellor may have been subject to \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m activities by our American partners. This undermines trust, and this can \u001b[43mharm\u001b[0m our friendship,\" said Mr Westerwelle. \"We need the truth now.\" German government and intelligence sources confirmed that it had evidence leading to \"firm suspicions\" suggesting the chancellor's mobile telephone was \"monitored\" by the NSA. According to German sources a Nokia 6210 Slide, supplied by Mrs Merkel's Germany's Christian Democrat party and used by her from October 2009 until July this year, was susceptible to bugging by the US. The number of the Nokia telephone, used for her most private calls, was listed on documents leaked by Mr Snowden. As the US \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m scandal emerged this summer, the German leader switched to an encrypted federal government Black-Berry Z10 smart phone, one of 5,000 distributed to officials and diplomats.In marked contrast to other European leaders, Mr Cameron's official spokesman tried to play down the row, insisting that the matter was only a \"bilateral issue\" which would not derail the vital trade talks between the EU and the US. \"There may be bilateral issues that individual countries raise between themselves but in terms of the EU-US free trade agreement this is a multi-national thing and I certainly would not see a connection between those two,\" he said.Nina Schick, of the Open Europe thinktank, said: \"This puts Cameron in a dif-ficult position. The EU-US trade negotiations, in which the UK is investing lots of political capital, could end up as collateral damage in this spat.\" Nigel West: Page 27\n",

      "AMERICA'S \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m apparatus must be placed under \"additional constraints\", the White House admitted yesterday, as the Spanish government expressed \"serious concern\" that electronic eavesdropping had targeted as many as 60 million phone calls in a month. \"We recognise there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence,\" said Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, as pressure grew on Washington from Europe to rein in \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m operations that included bugging the phone of the German chancellor. The Spanish government said reports that America's National Security Agency (NSA) had eavesdropped on 60.5 million telephone calls in Spain were \"inappropriate and unacceptable\". James Costos, the US ambassador to Madrid, was summoned to the Spanish foreign ministry yesterday to explain the fresh allegations, which were drawn from a stash of secrets stolen by the NSA \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m contractor Edward Snowden.The White House has denied that Barack Obama had prior knowledge of the tapping of world leaders' phones, but spoke yesterday of new \"constraints\" as part of a \"rigorous\" intelligence review ordered by the president last August. \"Our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that we are properly accounting for both the \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m of our citizens and our allies and the \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world,\" Mr Carney added. A senior Democrat broke ranks last night to deplore the bugging of world leaders' phones, pledging a \"major review\" of intelligence operations. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: \"Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be \u001b[43mcollecting\u001b[0m phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers.\" If confirmed, the interception of calls would mark \"a rupture in the mutual trust\" between Madrid and Washington, said José Manuel García-Margallo, the Spanish foreign minister. He added that Spain had not received official confirmation of the alleged spying, but that it has demanded the US provide all the necessary information. The rift between Europe and the US has led to some calls to hold up transatlantic trade talks and other forms of cooperation, including \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m to the SWIFT banking system, until a new protocol to limit NSA \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m is agreed. The concession from the US also came as two European parliamentary delegations arrived in Washington yesterday, with a German delegation expected later in the week, to discuss the allegations. Delegations from the European Parliament's foreign affairs and civil liberties committees stopped short of outright threats, but warned that counter-terrorism co-operation with the US must include better dataprotection for EU citizens. Claude Moraes, a British MEP leading a European parliamentary inquiry into the NSA mass surveillance, warned that German complaints about NSA \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m could cause short-term delays to the negotiation of an EU-US trade pact. \"The German national response may compromise things for a short while,\" Mr Moraes said. \"We need to avoid posturing, but this [the \u001b[43mSnowden\u001b[0m revelations] clearly points to something going wrong. We just need to adjust that. We need to pay attention to the scale and proportionality of what's going on.\" The article about \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m on Spain was written for El Mundo by Glenn Greenwald, the American journalist, who has worked with \u001b[43mSnowden\u001b[0m to \u001b[43mpublish\u001b[0m the NSA \u001b[43mspying\u001b[0m revelations. It stated that on one day alone, Dec 11, a total of 3.5 million calls were recorded. \"The interception carried out by the United States also includes the \u001b[43mintrusion\u001b[0m in \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m through the internet browser, email and \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m networks such as Twitter and Facebook,\" the authors write. During the same month-long period, the NSA was also reported to have secretly monitored 46 million calls in Italy.\n",

      "YESTERDAY'S Ofcom report raises questions about the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards' inquiry into the \"cash for access\" revelations. Here we compare her published verdict with what the broadcast regulator concluded.Inaccurate reporting What the Parliamentary report found: \"We note the Commissioner's view that if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by the two Members in their interviews, and measured their words against the rules of the House, it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of two individuals and those around them, and to the reputation of the House.\" Ofcom: \"While the programme did not set out all the detail behind the interactions between the two MPs and the programme makers, the programme contained, overall, a fair and accurate presentation of the background to the secretly filmed footage of the two MPs.\"Rifkind's employment Sir Malcolm said he was self-employed, despite his MP's salary of £67,000. Parliamentary report: Mrs Hudson said the remarks were \"unwise comments\", the context of which \"became much clearer during my investigation, when I had the benefit of the transcripts of the unedited interviews\". She said way the comments were reported \"coloured much of the publicity surrounding the television programme\".Ofcom: The watchdog found \"Sir Malcolm Rifkind's comments were accurately presented in the programme and that, overall, they were placed in their correct context. In particular, the narration explained that these comments were made in response to a question as to whether he had time to take on the role\".Access to ambassadors Parliamentary report: Highlights Sir Malcolm's comments to Mrs Hudson that the reporting used his \"remark on knowing foreign ambassadors in London with the clear inference that this was what I thought I could bring to a role on their board. The transcript makes clear that that is a dishonest distortion of what was actually said\". Mrs Hudson did not address these remarks in her conclusion. Sir Malcolm told the commissioner it was a \"disturbing example of how 'cut and paste' journalism can not only sensationalise but also be used, deliberately or through incompetence, to mislead the viewer\".Ofcom: \"The footage included in the programme accurately represented the comments made by Sir Malcolm Rifkind to the effect that he had an ability to see foreign ambassadors if he wished to do so as being made in the context of a general discussion about the type of assistance he could provide to PMR Communications if he joined the advisory board. We considered that Sir Malcolm Rifkind's comments were placed in their correct context.\"Straw 'under the radar' Parliamentary report: \"His connection to ED&amp;F Man supports his assertion that his interest was fully \u001b[43mdisclosed\u001b[0m and the term 'under the radar' refers to his approach to a delicate matter... I have found no evidence that the work Mr Straw has done on behalf of ED&amp;F Man has been outside the Rules of the House.\" Ofcom: \"Mr Straw's comments were accurately presented in the programme and that they were placed in their correct context... We further noted that the meaning of 'under the radar' in this context was ambiguous, and that this could be seen as a reference to having negotiations out of the public spotlight, but that this did not necessarily indicate any form of misconduct on the part of Mr Straw.\"Did they \u001b[43mbreach\u001b[0m the rules? Parliamentary report: \"It must also concern all those who value the reputations of the House... that those reputations proved so easy to tarnish. For the truth was that in this situation, there was no \u001b[43mbreach\u001b[0m of the rules on paid lobbying.\"Ofcom: \"The programme did not allege that the MPs had breached Parliamentary Rules. In our view, the programme questioned whether their conduct fell short of public expectations for MPs, regardless of whether or not their conduct complied with those Rules.\"Appropriate journalism? The Standards Committee indicated that Parliament might wish to consider whether it was appropriate for \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m organisations to investigate MPs using undercover reporters.Ofcom: \"The programme was a serious piece of broadcast journalism... there was a significant public interest in the programme-makers exploring the conduct of both Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Mr Straw, who were prominent parliamentarians and had held a number of senior ministerial positions including Foreign Secretary, in relation to their commercial interests and their attitude to the potential conflict these interests might have with their political commitments… There was a genuine public interest justification in Channel 4 agreeing that the programme makers should undertake secret filming.\"Head to head The two chiefs ?Sharon White, 48, chief executive, Ofcom (since March 2015) Salary £275,000 Other positions held Director General at HM Treasury, Ministry of Justice and Department for International Development Early career Worked in Treasury in early 1990s, before spending time at British embassy in Washington and No 10 \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m unit analysing welfare reforms Education Comprehensive in Leyton, east London.

Among its legal duties are to ensure that people are protected from being treated unfairly in television programmes.did it investigate Channel 4? QWhy A Channel 4 referred itself to the regulator. Ofcom did not receive a complaint about fairness from Sir Malcolm Rifkind or Jack Straw, but it can investigate issues of fairness or \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m without a direct complaint. It investigated Dispatches in relation to fairness.are the Ofcom rules on fairness? QWhat A According to the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, care should be taken \"to ensure that material facts have not been presented, disregarded or omitted in a way that is unfair to an individual or organisation\".Where allegations of incompetence or wrongdoing are made, individuals should be able to respond. The code also states that \"surreptitious filming\" may be warranted \"if it is in the public interest and cannot reasonably be obtained by other means\".Q How does Ofcom investigate potential \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m of standards? A Complaints are investigated by its Content, Standards, Licensing and Enforcement team. Channel 4 provided unedited footage of the secretly filmed meetings and transcripts. Ofcom provides the broadcaster and any relevant third party with its preliminary view so they can make representations. In this case, both parties declined.is the final decision made?

      "PIPPA MIDDLETON has started a High Court action to \u001b[43mprotect\u001b[0m her \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m after \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m photographs of her and her family were allegedly stolen by a computer hacker.The 33-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge has lodged a case in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court in London against an unnamed person, which is due to be heard this morning.It is thought the case relates to the \u001b[43mtheft\u001b[0m of photographs from her iCloud account, which emerged at the weekend. More than 3,000 photographs of her and her family and friends were allegedly \u001b[43mhacked\u001b[0m from Apple's iCloud based server, where people can store \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m remotely.Some of the images that were allegedly \u001b[43mhacked\u001b[0m from Miss Middleton's account were understood to feature the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. It was also reported that other pictures featured Miss Middleton, who recently became engaged to James Matthews, a hedge fund manager, trying on her wedding dress.The Queen's Bench Division is where judges consider issues of \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m and libel and while details of the case have not been made public, it is thought Miss Middleton could be seeking an injunction or legal protection to prevent the photographs being shared or disseminated.Scotland Yard opened an investigation into the alleged hacking of Miss Middleton's iCloud account after it was claimed that someone had offered \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m photographs of her for sale for £50,000. On Sunday it was revealed that Nathan Wyatt, 35, a website designer from Wellingborough, Northants, had been arrested on suspicion of a Computer Misuse \u001b[43mAct\u001b[0m offence. His three bedroom house was searched by forensic officers. He was bailed by police to return to a south London police station on a date in late November.It was reported that a seller, identifying themselves as the Crafty Cockney, had approached a tabloid newspaper claiming to have 3,000 private photographs belonging to Miss Middleton. While there is no suggestion any reputable organisation in the UK would reproduce the images, there were fears that they could be published overseas.Sources close to Miss Middleton said she had spoken to her lawyers and they had been in touch with the police.\n",

      "'We should all assume someone may be watching, Jeremy, even though we cannot know for certain if or when they are definitely watching. We have made the world a virtual panopticon.\" So speaks an Egyptian scholar near the end of I Am No One, Patrick Flanery's disquieting new novel about surveillance.The panopticon, Jeremy Bentham's 18th-century design for a prison in which all inmates could be observed at all times, has become a popular metaphor for the internet and an age which, as Flanery's novel takes for granted, has reached \"the end of privacy\".The narrator, another Jeremy, is a fiftysomething American academic who has spent the past decade teaching at Oxford and has recently returned to New York City to strengthen ties with his daughter, who has married a young \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m tycoon. The glassedin comfort, \"barring revolution\", of his daughter's life is a safety bubble. Jeremy, however, is a sitting duck for all kinds of unwarranted intrusions.First, someone hacks his email account, unaccountably messing with his appointments. Then he receives a package containing a printout of all his internet activity. He keeps bumping into the same obnoxious stranger and acquires a stalker. But what kind of surveillor is this, so keen to let him know he is being watched? The reasons unravel, as Jeremy remembers a relationship with a former student.Jeremy is a historian with an interest in the Stasi, also lecturing on films about \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m and art made from CCTV images. He appreciates more than most how the everyday is altered by burglar alarms, mobile phones, drones and satellites. Early on, he mentions in an eerily offhand manner that a Syrian student made threats against him in his early days at Oxford: \"I reported the young man to the terrorist hotline that Britain had then set up and within a few days he disappeared and no more was ever heard of him.\"As the packages continue to arrive, Jeremy becomes paranoid. Confronted with emails sent from his account that he has no memory of writing, he wonders whether the person sending the papers could really be a previous version of himself. He asks: can I \"know what I am beneath the conscious fiction I present to others as well as myself \"? Flanery is the author of two previous novels, Absolution, set in a turbulent South Africa, and The Fallen Land, set against the boom and bust of the US housing market. Both are weighty, but readable, stories that touch on intrusions of privacy. I Am No One is also compelling, yet one can't help but think that with such a vastly suggestive subject (in \"our post-Snowden world\", as the book jacket puts it), the impact of \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m on identity, communication and relationships remains oddly under-explored.The narrative voice is fond of subordinate clauses: \"I could see almost at once, however, that Meredith and Peter had been talking and there was something they needed to say, as if they had - this turned out to be the case - made a decision about me in the hours following my confession of the unexplainable lacuna in my memory, or so it then seemed.\" The interminable circumspection, exasperating at times, makes Jeremy an ambiguous figure, as unsure of his own motives as he is of those who watch him. \"I'm no one,\" he tells his daughter. Unfortunately, his everyman potential means that he is not quite individual enough to sustain his narrative's self-obsession.There are some suspenseful moments, but as the novel digresses into romance it seems aware of its shortcomings. \"Campus melodrama or \u001b[43mspy\u001b[0m thriller. In what genre am I trapped?\" Jeremy wonders. An American alien in the UK, he talks about dislocation from his national identity; but it turns out that he was being disingenuous when he insisted that he had no idea why the National Security Agency or anyone else would want to \u001b[43mtrack\u001b[0m him.The most interesting of the novel's ambiguities is that Jeremy is acutely aware of the depressing prospect of ending up unobserved, ignored. By the end of the novel, he finds that living with the permanent possibility of being visible is a fairly modest dystopia when, on the other hand, there might be nobody watching.To order this book from the Telegraph for £10.99 plus £1.99 p&amp;p call 0844 871 1515\n",

      "THE FBI believes it may have found a way to \u001b[43mhack\u001b[0m into an encrypted iPhone in a surprise development that could end a bitter legal confrontation with Apple over privacy.The two sides were due to square up in court today in the latest round of a very public battle.The outcome would decide whether the technology giant could be forced to develop software to sidestep encryption and \u001b[43mreveal\u001b[0m \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m from a phone belonging to Syed Rizwan Farook, who was shot dead alongside his wife in a terrorist \u001b[43mattack\u001b[0m last year that killed 14 people.Investigators believe the phone could \u001b[43mreveal\u001b[0m details of links to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or other groups, while Apple argues that complying with the request would \u001b[43mharm\u001b[0m \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m for anyone using encryption.Yesterday, prosecutors filed papers saying an outside party had shown the FBI a possible way to unlock the phone at the weekend and asked for the hearing to be postponed.\"Testing is required to determine whether it is a viable method that will not compromise \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m on Farook's iPhone,\" it said.\"If the method is viable, it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple Inc set forth in the All Writs \u001b[43mAct\u001b[0m Order in this case.\"The filing means the government can avoid - for now - a confrontation which pitted it against much of the tech industry, which argues that developing a backdoor route into phones would render everyday encryption useless.But governments around the world fear that the technology allows criminals to mask their activities.\n",

      "Drivers who make calls at the wheel could find that their insurance premiums rocket under plans by insurers to \u001b[43mmonitor\u001b[0m illegal calls and texts made while driving.Existing \"telematic\" underwriting - which allows insurers to assess policyholders' driving habits and skills - can already log when drivers' phones are in use and whether a hands-free device is connected.Mobile phone use at the wheel could prompt warnings from insurers and result in premium increases - or even the withdrawal of cover.Telematics increasingly involves drivers being tracked via their mobile phones through an app that they have downloaded. This can tell the insurer when and where the vehicle is in use, as well as communicate detailed \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m about braking, acceleration and cornering.What is less well understood is the app's ability to \u001b[43mmonitor\u001b[0m other phone functions, enabling it to detect whether calls are being made - and if they are hands-free.The app runs in the background of the phone. In theory, an insurer could see in even greater detail what a driver is doing, including whether or not they are playing music, using \u001b[43mmapping\u001b[0m services, or texting. One insurance broker, Drivology, has already used the technology to \u001b[43mcollect\u001b[0m extensive \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m about how using a phone at the wheel affects driving behaviour.Drivers with convictions for texting or calling at the wheel already face rises in their premiums - but this technology enables insurers to increase premiums before an accident has even happened.Data from the AA shows that insurers put up premiums by as much as 28pc if a driver is caught by police using their phone at the wheel.Many will refuse to offer cover altogether.Monitoring calls, texts and \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m use Wunelli, which provides telematics technology to insurers including the AA, Hastings Direct, Admiral, and the Co-op, said drivers who had consented to having their driving behaviour recorded via their smartphone could also have their call \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m monitored.To date, telematics policies are offered primarily to young drivers with a promise that they will make car insurance more affordable. Average premiums for 17-24-year-olds have grown to more than £1,200.The popularity and use of telematics is spreading. According to the British Insurance Brokers' Association, telematics policies have grown by 23pc over the past year and are now used by 561,500 drivers.Around a quarter of these are thought to be policies that work through apps on smartphones. Other policies \u001b[43mmonitor\u001b[0m driving through \"black boxes\" that have to be installed in a car.Insurers say the policies reduce premiums for an overwhelming majority of drivers. Admiral, for example, says 80pc of drivers using its \"LittleBox\" \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m pay less when they renew.But some drivers have complained that their driving behaviour has been incorrectly recorded, leading to increased costs.Selim Cavanagh of Wunelli said the company \u001b[43mcollected\u001b[0m phone \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m on behalf of some insurers, but declined to name them.\"The objective is twofold: firstly, enable insurers to price fairly; secondly, educating the driver to these road risks,\" he said.Using the firm's technology, more than 4,000 drivers, customers of Drivology, had their mobile phone use while driving monitored over 18 months. The research found that drivers using a phone at the wheel produced similar reaction times to drunk drivers.Concerns about errors by telematics systems - such as passenger use of a phone being misinterpreted as someone making a call at the wheel - have slowed the roll-out. Drivology initially told Telegraph Money that it \u001b[43mcollected\u001b[0m phone call \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and used it to determine premiums, but later backtracked.Simon Morrissey, head of \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m at \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m firm Lewis Silkin (pictured on Page 1), said insurers needed to be more honest about \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m collection.\"That type of 'cross-pollination of information', where one app knows what you're doing on other apps, creates a \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m issue. In my view, if they know that you're using your phone while driving, that is intrusive,\" he said.Jonathan Hewett of Octo Telematics said his firm was working on the \"next wave\" of technology, which would overcome these issues - and he was confident that more insurers would start to use the technology.\"The only resistance is a perception that it would be a barrier for consumers. There's concern that they would see it as a Big Brother scenario,\" he said.\"But there is also huge concern from insurers about distracted driving. Our current clients are interested and the topic is increasingly in everybody's mind.\"In November the Government doubled the penalty for drivers caught making calls at the wheel to six points and a £200 fine.New drivers will face an immediate disqualification if apprehended.\n",

      "Mumsnet now has levels of online \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m on a par with what you might expect from your bank - but then the popular parent site has been \u001b[43mhacked\u001b[0m twice.Privacy is at stake because some Mumsnetters air their innermost thoughts online, believing they are protected by anonymity. So when cybercriminals \u001b[43mhacked\u001b[0m the site in 2014 and 2015, 1.5 million users were asked twice to reset their details.Such is the devotion of users that Mumsnet weathered the storm. \"I think we've reclaimed our trust but it was definitely a moment of crisis,\" Mumsnet's head of \u001b[43mpolicy\u001b[0m and campaigns, Rowan Davies, told The Telegraph's Festival of Business. Backroom \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m has been beefed to be with the breached Decoded up and moderators regularly reminded of how easy it is to open the door to cybercriminals.It appears no longer a question of if but when a business will be hacked, say cybersecurity professionals. \"Companies need to be comfortable with the idea of being breached,\" says Sam Nixon, product owner of technology educator Decoded. Information \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m needs prominence at board level, rather than remaining a backroom operation. \"It's not a hindrance. It's a core part of the business and that's how you need to think about it.\"THE IMPACT OF REMOTE WORKINGA cultural shift has taken place at work, particularly among millennials, says Phil Lander, director of mobile and IT, B2B, at Samsung Europe.Mobile technology means \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m life spills into working life and vice versa. And as more employees use their own smartphones for work, a company's systems are potentially more vulnerable to infiltration. \"The working day has changed,\" says Mr Lander. \"More people are accessing systems remotely.\"Last year 46pc of businesses in the UK suffered a cyber-attack, the latest government figures show - nearly twice as many as the previous year. Costs of \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m vary but can prove catastrophic for smaller firms, says Mr Lander. But Samsung's research shows that while 70pc of larger organisations say cybersecurity ranks in their top three concerns, just 30pc of smaller businesses agree.\"But by 2020, 70pc of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to be mobile employees and that changes the shape of the \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m needs for these businesses,\" he says. \"Research shows that in 2015-16 in the UK alone, businesses spent £10.9m on cybercrime. It's a big problem.\"A TWIN-DEFENCE APPROACHThere are two ways to \u001b[43mhack\u001b[0m a business: through the technology itself or through the people who work there. And building defences to keep out cybercriminals requires a twin approach along these lines, says Mr Lander.\"We're in an age of digital Darwinism - the internet of things, artificial intelligence, mobilisation. There're so many choices - why not embrace it?\" Samsung, for instance, has just helped TSB to become the first UK bank to install iris recognition technology as a \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m layer for consumers. \"So the technology is there - you need to find the solution you need.\"But more often than not, human error gives cybercriminals the \"in\" they need to wreak havoc. Mumsnet's second \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m \u001b[43mbreach\u001b[0m occurred after a phishing \u001b[43mattack\u001b[0m - a fake message designed to trick an individual into revealing \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m information. Thousands of highly convincing scam messages are sent every day - and so individual staff, including increasing numbers of remote workers, need to be kept aware.\"People might feel ashamed that they have been scammed,\" says Ms Davies. In fact, they should broadcast it as an example, and company culture should welcome this, she says. \"Whenever our tech team sees something dodgy - a phishing email, say - they forward it to staff saying 'here's an example of a scam'. Falling for it shouldn't be shaming.\"Attacks are not always online - criminals might gain \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m through a phone call, even in person, says Mr Nixon. But once they're in a system, passwords are often lamentably easy to crack. \"Phishing is the biggest threat by far faced by organisations, but is rarely used in isolation. Think of it like being conned. Password managers are a cheap solution to this. Or having two-stage authentication - such as having to enter a code from your phone.\"Having a plan when it all goes wrong is also essential, says Mr Lander. And when new \u001b[43mGDPR\u001b[0m (General \u001b[43mData\u001b[0m Protection Regulation) comes into force next May, businesses will be obliged to report certain \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m within 72 hours after becoming aware. \"You need to run through potential scenarios,\" he says. \"Each team, from comms to technical, should know their role when the crisis hits. Education is key.\"Firms need to be comfortable with the idea of being breached Sam Nixon, Decoded\n",

      "SCOTTISH head teachers will be forced to have lawyers on \"speed dial\" or \u001b[43mrisk\u001b[0m court action from angry parents when they start carrying out the SNP's \"state guardian\" role, legal chiefs warned a Holyrood inquiry yesterday.The Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates told MSPs that the Named Person role presented a legal minefield for those filling the post.They warned that local authorities and potentially the individual teachers and health workers who filled the post would face litigation if they shared or did not \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m sensitive \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m on children without parents' consent.Giving evidence to Holyrood's education committee, the Royal College of Nursing also warned its members could become \"defensive\" about \u001b[43msharing\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m about at-risk children for fear of breaking the law.Liz Smith, the Scottish Tories' shadow education minister, called for the entire scheme to be scrapped. She said the interventions had \"demolished\" the SNP's attempts to respond to the UK Supreme Court, which ruled that the original Named Person plan infringed parents' human rights.SNP ministers introduced the scheme to \u001b[43midentify\u001b[0m atrisk children sooner but were forced to drastically water down its powers following the court ruling. John Swinney, the Education Minister, unveiled a new Bill scrapping a statutory duty for state guardians to \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m and replacing it with a responsibility to consider if that would help a child's well-being.However, Named Persons will have to comply with the \u001b[43mData\u001b[0m Protection Act, the European Convention of Human Rights and common \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m rules around confidentiality. A draft code of practice published alongside the \u001b[43mlegislation\u001b[0m states that Named Persons \"must be able to justify the interference\" to the \u001b[43mright\u001b[0m to \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m under the law.Janys Scott QC, of the Faculty of Advocates, told the committee Named Persons could end up in a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't situation\" as they would have to weigh up whether \u001b[43msharing\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m would \"result in a problem which is more serious than not sharing\".\"That strikes me as something which would be unattractive,\" she added.Kenny Meechan, of the Law Society, said: \"I could imagine a lot of people given Named Person responsibilities having their legal departments on speed dial.\"He said it was a \"near-impossible task\" to \u001b[43mlegislate\u001b[0m on \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection at the moment because it was \"very much a moving target\" in the context of an ongoing overhaul of UK \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m laws.Ms Scott said individual teachers could \"potentially\" face litigation if they made the wrong call, although Mr Meechan said local authorities, as the \"employer organisation\", were more likely to bear the brunt.But, Tavish Scott, a Lib Dem MSP, said teachers could become responsible due to education governance reforms going through Holyrood that would make head teachers rather than councils responsible for the running of their schools.Both legal experts then accepted that heads would face the \"potential\" for litigation after the governance changes were put in place.\n",

      "Apollster surveys a potential voter. She's a 55-year-old rural mother and GP who drives a Mercedes and watches period dramas. But in a fit of pique after a day spent dealing with NHS budget cuts, she declares she's backing Jeremy Corbyn. Until recently, the pollster would \u001b[43mrecord\u001b[0m one datapoint from all of this information: a Labour vote. You and I know better, though. In the cool light of polling day, the \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m points in the opposite direction. Our GP is very likely a Tory voter.Pollsters are trying to get cleverer. Yesterday, YouGov released the results of an electoral model that drew a shocking conclusion: Labour could actually gain, rather than lose seats, next week.Based on any gut feeling, this looks absurd. It hardly seems like a promising first step for a new approach to polling. The dramatic headline disguises an interesting shift, however. Rather than trusting what voters say, pollsters are starting to assess how they behave.The YouGov model attempts to incorporate demographic and historic \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m to discover correlations. The sort of estimate it might make, for example, is that people under 25 who co-rent a London flat are half as likely to vote as rural home owners. What people say about their voting intention simply becomes another \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m point on top, and it's often not a very reliable one.Unfortunately, this first attempt is still heavily reliant on polling \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and only has basic census demographic data. Marcus Roberts of YouGov forecasts that it will become \"more and more powerful as time goes on\".The path it's heading down is well-worn by advertisers. The most advanced companies use sophisticated models full of all sorts of \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m about potential customers. Search for conveyancers and \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m might well start displaying adverts for new furniture and DIY tools.What pollsters are now realising is that voting is no different. They aren't the first to realise it. Such methods are thought to have played a role in Russia's propaganda-targeting activities during the US elections.Russian spies, of course, don't stop at \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m or \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m laws. But even just using readily available public information, campaigners and pollsters are becoming hugely more sophisticated.What makes this possible is that people are predictable. We like to think we are rational, freethinking individuals making enlightened choices, but many of those choices are probably so highly correlated with other factors as to be foreseeable by an \u001b[43malgorithm\u001b[0m using enough data.Democracy might look spontaneous, but pollsters are now pursuing the depressing, alternative theory: in fact, it's as predictable as your Amazon shopping basket.Archaeologists have unearthed a splendid Roman bath house in Chichester. The spa complex was probably used by a well-to-do aristocrat of Roman Britain, they reckon, because it would have been so incredibly expensive to build.At another frontier of the Roman Empire, in Israel last week, I was lucky enough to visit Masada, a dramatic hill fort overlooking the Dead Sea, with Guy Stiebel, the man leading a renewal of excavations on the site after a decade. The complex is famous in Israel for being the last stronghold of Judaean rebels and refugees resisting Roman rule. King Herod, unlike them, was an avowed Rome-ophile. Masada was a remote outpost, but one decked out with all sorts of Roman luxuries, including a bathhouse, gardens, a palace and, incredibly, a massive delivery of fine Italian wine in amphorae bearing a label that it was for \"Herod, King of Judea\".Amid all the remains of luxury, however, Dr Stiebel had more humble interests. Visitors shouldn't just think about the soldiers and kings, he said, but all the practicalities and ordinary people living there. He wanted visitors to notice the remains of a bakery, in which were found little fragments bearing orders of breads for people who lived in the complex. Blankets and sandals, perhaps belonging to refugees, have been recovered among the rubble. He is busy at the moment uncovering the remains of a huge cistern, perhaps not glamorous, but rather important in a desert.The Chichester bath house is no doubt testament to the huge wealth accumulated in Roman Britain. But it's also testament to the whole supply chain around it: the masseuses, slaves, traders and artisans who made it run. Amid the pillars and statues will surely lie humbler, but no less vital, fragments of history.Recently, a friend has been sending me winding, existential screeds about his life. Fortunately, Gmail, my email provider, now has a new service available, called \"smart reply\", for such situations.At the bottom of each message, next to the \"reply\" button, it has suggested three responses, which I can send by clicking on them. \"I agree with you,\" is the first. \"I don't know,\" it suggests, second. And lastly, most appropriately, \" What?\" This might be artificial, but it's not quite intelligence. It has not yet mastered the art of the sympathetic but vague and suitably long reply. It might work well in response to short emails that require a simple \"yes\" or \"what time?\", but even in those cases it is simply too creepy to use. So I've turned it off.follow Juliet Samuel on Twitter @CitySamuel; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion\n",

      "OPERATIONS to prevent child abuse in the UK could be damaged by a new EU law, civil servants at the Home Office fear.Their concerns that child pornography could end up being \"freely traded\" online have been revealed in a leaked memo on the forthcoming European \u001b[43mPrivacy\u001b[0m Regulation (EPR).The civil servants believe that the new \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m law, which is due to be debated by the EU's Council of Ministers tomorrow, will effectively ban tech companies from using software to proactively scan billions of images online for abuse.Software including Microsoft's PhotoDNA, which scans photos against \u001b[43mdatabases\u001b[0m of abuse images, could be interpreted as a \u001b[43mbreach\u001b[0m of paedophiles' \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m under the EPR.The memo argues this could mean more children being abused as paedophiles evade detection.In the memo, the officials call for the regulations to include an exemption to users' \u001b[43mright\u001b[0m to \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m in cases of abuse images.It cited the example of Facebook, which found more than 8.5million exploitation images last year, 99 per cent of which were uncovered through AI scanning.The memo added that 150 victims of child abuse had been \u001b[43midentified\u001b[0m and reached by police this year solely from Facebook's detection of images.In a section titled \"what would happen if the scanning stopped\", the memo said: \"[Abuse] material would be freely traded by offenders on mainstream platforms, offenders could groom children without detection, and offenders accessing and abusing children offline would not be apprehended.\"Children's charities from across the world have written to senior EU officials warning against the current draft of EPR.The letter, seen by The Daily Telegraph, said the EPR would have \"a seriously damaging impact on the safety and well-being of children\".It added: \"We are at a loss to understand why the EU feels it is necessary to step in and disrupt established practices which … work so well.\"Individual nations can opt out of the parts of the \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m affecting scanning software, but that would involve separate acts in each country's parliament, which charities say would lead to a \"patchwork\" of \u001b[43mlaws\u001b[0m that would also hinder child protection efforts.John Carr, the secretary of the UK Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety, told The Telegraph: \"It would break down the [child abuse image scanning] system in the UK.\"So a large volume of illegal images would be available to paedophiles and others in Britain. It's gift for paedophiles.\"A Home Office spokesman said: \"We have taken note of the EU's proposal for the introduction of the European \u001b[43mPrivacy\u001b[0m Regulation and are discussing it with EU member states.\"\n",

      "FACEBOOK, Twitter and \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m are facing the threat of new taxes to help fund a crackdown on fake news and misinformation that is poisoning British democracy, according to MPs.A report from the digital, culture, \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m and sport select committee proposed that \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m and other \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m firms should pay a levy to cover the costs of Britain's \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).Damian Collins MP, the chairman of the committee, called for urgent action to tackle the threat posed by fake news, including \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m being liable for the content posted online, possibly exposing them to lawsuits from people who have been targeted by hate speech.The report warned of \"relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behaviour\".A version was leaked yesterday by Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaign strategist, ahead of its official publication tomorrow.The ICO is investigating the Cambridge \u001b[43mAnalytica\u001b[0m scandal, in which 87million \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m users had their \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m \u001b[43mcollected\u001b[0m without their \u001b[43mconsent\u001b[0m and passed to the British election consultants. A levy, understood to work similarly to the charges imposed on financial services in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority, would also cover the cost of introducing \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m and \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m protection onto the national curriculum to improve pupils' understanding of how \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m may be used to manipulate them.MPs also suggested companies should no longer enjoy being a grey area between \"platform\" and \"publisher\" but face liability for what is published on their products, after the example of Germany, which has greater powers to fine technology companies for offensive material such as hate speech.Germany's Network Enforcement Act, sometimes known as the \"Facebook Law\", came into force in January and requires companies to block obviously illegal content within strict deadlines or face fines of up to (EURO)50million. A previous EU report covering 2017, measuring slightly different criteria, found the three companies responded to complaints within 24 hours in 77 per cent of cases on average.Mark Zuckerberg faces pressure to abandon his dual role as chairman and chief executive after $199billion was wiped off Facebook's value on Thursday, the biggest one-day loss of value for any company in US market history.Investors baulked after a series of scandals involving fake news, cyber bullying, terrorism recruitment and Zuckerberg's refusal to remove Holocaust denial from the platform. \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m has been forced to hire thousands of moderators to curb extremist content and has warned that the costs will eat at its bottom line.MPs claimed that the existing legal \u001b[43mframework\u001b[0m was \"no longer fit for purpose\" and did not take into account the technology giants that have become prevalent in Britons' day-to-day lives.The report also suggested that the Competition and Market Authority be tasked with auditing Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fake accounts or \"bots\", which have been blamed for the rapid spread of fake news before the EU referendum and the US election.Mr Collins said: \"Companies like \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m made it easy for developers to scrape \u001b[43muser\u001b[0m \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and to deploy it in other campaigns without their knowledge or consent. Throughout our inquiry these companies have tried to frustrate scrutiny and obfuscated in their answers. \"The light of transparency must be allowed to shine on their operations and they must be made responsible, and liable, for the way in which harmful and misleading content is shared.\"Juliet Samuel: Page 17(EURO)50m Potential fine for failing to meet deadlines to block obviously illegal content under Germany's Network Enforcement \u001b[43mAct\u001b[0m\n",

      "POLICE use of \u001b[43mfacial\u001b[0m recognition technology could be blocked as the official \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m watchdog warned of her \"deep concerns\" over its potential threat to people's privacy.Elizabeth Denham, the \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m commissioner, said that although she appreciated the purpose was to \"catch criminals\", the trials of the technology involved the \"widespread \u001b[43mprocessing\u001b[0m of biometric \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m of thousands of people as they go about their daily lives\". \"There remain significant \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m and \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection issues that must be addressed, and I remain deeply concerned about the roll-out of this technology,\" she said in a blog post yesterday. \"I believe that there needs to be demonstrable evidence that the technology is necessary, proportionate and effective considering the invasiveness of Live Facial Recognition (LFR).\" Ms Denham is conducting an investigation into the technology which has been trialled by the South Wales and Met police forces. But before publishing her findings, she is awaiting the outcome of a court case against South Wales Police, which could rule that LFR \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m and is unlawful.A member of the public, backed by the civil rights group Liberty, claims his image may have been captured unlawfully on LFR from a police van while he was shopping in Cardiff city centre.They claim it violated his \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m and \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection rights by \u001b[43mprocessing\u001b[0m an image taken of him in public, action which he says caused him \"distress\".South Wales Police says its use of \u001b[43mfacial\u001b[0m recognition technology does not infringe \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m or \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m protection rights as it is used in the same way as photographing in public, and it does not retain the \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m of those not on its watch list.

      "IMAGES GETTY f you'd reserved a space in your tea towel drawer for a piece of Baby Sussex memorabilia, you would be disappointed. The birth of Prince Harry's and Meghan Markle's son will be a largely private affair, with no official commemorative plate, mug or dishcloth emblazoned in his honour. The aim of his parents is to give Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor as \"normal\" a start in life as possible - which, one imagines, means not very normal at all, what with his father being, you know, a prince, and his American mother a former actress. But who - apart from a multi-million-strong army of royal fans on both sides of the Atlantic, along with most \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m outlets - could blame them for wanting to \u001b[43mprotect\u001b[0m their child's privacy? REUTERS; INSTAGRAM; It's clear that they mean it, too.Then again, the road to Instagram is paved with good intentions such as these. The reality is, some photographs just seem too perfect to conceal from the world. This might explain the appearance of the image of a female hand cradling a newborn baby's feet on the Duke and Duchess's official Instagram account on Sunday. Sure, sure, it was American Mothers' Day, an event too momentous to go unmarked with a huge Insta-cliché. We get it.But this is no slight against the Sussexes. If anything, it helps furnish Archie with the impossible normal childhood they crave for him, and is therefore in line with their goals: he will grow up sharing, in common with every modern child, the indignity of appearing in an overused \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m trope. And what, today, could be more gloriously banal? Besides, the Instagram cliché is such an easy trap to fall into as a parent, and was an accident waiting to happen for the Sussexes. If they wish to avoid any more, here's what not to do...Interlinked fingers Like the popular feet-in-hand image, the picture that shows nothing but your tiny baby's finger(s) hooked into your own has the benefit of protecting their privacy, and thus letting you continue speaking loftily on such matters. The not-sohidden subtext: my world is now complete. And please admire the artfully modest way I've captured this.Sunset of dreams This one is easy. All you need is an idyllic outdoor location and the perfect setting sun, captured just at the \u001b[43mright\u001b[0m time, before it gets too dark and you have to spend the rest of the evening fiddling about with filters to sort it out. Once you've located both of the above, simply lift your baby skywards and behold them with spontaneous rapture. The spontaneity, remember, is key: \"Oh, just look at what we happened to be doing - and where - when we commanded our other half to take that photo!\" Matching outfits In a similar vein, how cute is it when you and your mini-me by chance end up dressed similarly? The point is you can then write \"mini-me\" in the caption and watch those likes come flooding in like no one's ever done this before.Toddler holding/kissing/doing something else adorable to baby sibling What could be sweeter than a small child? An even smaller child, of course! And we all know the mathematical \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m that states very small children together are cuter than the sum of their parts. When you get to your mid-30s, you can hardly move on Instagram for toddlers with baby siblings placed precariously in their laps. Doesn't matter if baby topples off the sofa the second the picture's been taken. There's another mathematical \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m that states 300 \"likes\" is worth 10 hours in A&amp;E.Doing something inappropriately grown up Perhaps you happened to catch your child picking up an empty wine bottle you'd accidentally left on the table. Wouldn't it be hilarious to photograph that and add a witty caption about their drinking habits? A lot of parents think that it would. Likewise, if their three-year-old has tried on some stilettos, or smeared lipstick on their face, or climbed into the driver's seat.Obligatory special occasion picture Mothers' Day is just the tip iceberg. Every birthday, first day of World Book Da' Day, and so on is fair game. Even if you don't post, you can be sure that all your friends will. If you're short on inspiration, just search the name of the occasion along with its requisite hashtag. This is no time to be original.\n",

      "POSTING pictures of pets on Instagram is putting young people at \u001b[43mrisk\u001b[0m of fraud, a major bank has said as it warned under-25s against copying celebrities' bad online habits.Santander has said the celebrity trend of oversharing \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m on \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m media, such as the name of a pet or your birthday, can raise the \u001b[43mrisk\u001b[0m of \u001b[43midentity\u001b[0m fraud as people often use these details for passwords.Research by the bank found that a third of under-25s have copied celebrity posts and 87 per cent \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m on \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m media. One in 10 confessed they had shared the name of a pet on Instagram while also using it as a password. The bank said celebrities set a bad example by posting intimate details online, such as birthdays and the names of pets, which could be used by fraudsters.American singer Taylor Swift regularly posts on Instagram about her cats; Meredith, Olivia and Benjamin. And Kylie Jenner shares so much about her two dogs, Norman and Bambi, that they now have their own account with almost half a million followers.Earlier this year, soap actor Dean Gaffney, was criticised after revealing his bank details to almost 65,000 Instagram followers, when he posted a picture where the card number and expiry date were clearly visible.A survey of 2,000 people by One Poll, commissioned by Santander, found 40 per cent of under-25s are influenced by what celebrities post online, while 78 per cent do not know how to \u001b[43mprotect\u001b[0m themselves from \u001b[43midentity\u001b[0m theft. The results come as scam prevention charity CIFAS reports a 26 per cent rise in fraud cases targeting under-21s in 2018.Jodie Cook, a \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m expert, said: \"It's worrying to see influential celebrities \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m so many \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m details online. Sharing names of family members and your date of birth is risky and is turning people's \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m profiles into a fraudster's paradise.\"Ms Cook's tips for avoiding online fraud include: do not \u001b[43mreveal\u001b[0m your date of birth; do not overshare the name of your pets; avoid giving away family details like your middle name or mother's maiden name; do not disclose private memories such as where you were born; and make sure no sensitive documents are visible when posting photos. Chris Ainsley, head of fraud strategy at Santander, added: \"Check that your \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m settings are on, stay vigilant and consider what you're giving away before hitting 'post'.\"87pc The number of under-25s who are putting themselves at \u001b[43mrisk\u001b[0m of online fraud by \u001b[43msharing\u001b[0m \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m details on \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m\n",

      "THE BBC's failure to undertake adequate vetting of contributors to the Tory leadership debate is the latest crisis to befall the corporation's director of news.Fran Unsworth has ultimate responsibility for the BBC's news output and approved the programme format, saying it was \"in the public interest for audiences to question and hear from the next potential prime minister\".But researchers failed to \u001b[43midentify\u001b[0m Abdullah Patel's controversial opinions after he temporarily deactivated his Twitter account, hiding inflammatory posts. They had selected him from \"thousands\" who contacted the BBC with questions for the five leadership hopefuls.The BBC claimed to have \"verbally vetted\" Mr Patel but failed to \u001b[43midentify\u001b[0m anything troubling. It is understood they informed him at the end of last week that he was likely to appear on the programme, allowing him to wipe all trace of his \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m account by the time researchers conducted a web search for him on Monday.Unsworth's \u001b[43mtrack\u001b[0m \u001b[43mrecord\u001b[0m includes authorising BBC News to run footage of the police raid on the home of Sir Cliff Richard, a decision that led to the singer winning a \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m case and substantial damages against the station. She was also at the centre of the Carrie Gracie gender pay case, where she was called before a parliamentary select committee and forced to deny that she had described the then China editor as \"part-time\".Jonathan Munro, Unsworth's deputy, was executive producer of the debate. He reportedly sent an email to staff saying former BBC chiefs who criticised their news output were \"armchair generals\" who were \"making a few bob to supplement their pensions\".Rob Burley, the debate's editor, is head of live political programming and also responsible for The Andrew Marr Show. He defended the selection of Mr Patel, saying: \"We wouldn't have put him on the programme if these [tweets] were public before broadcast but they were not. We also carried out a number of other routine checks which didn't uncover anything untoward.\"The format of the show was criticised by many viewers and Emily Maitlis was said to be disappointed that the candidates spoke over her when she attempted to question them.'We would not have put him on if these tweets were public before the broadcast, but they were not'\n",

      "TECH giants will be grilled by senators today as they defend themselves from claims they have used their market dominance to unfairly crush competitors in Europe and the USA.Apple, Google, Amazon and \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m will testify before the Senate justice committee, which is conducting a \"top-to-bottom\" investigation into Silicon Valley's \"tremendous concentration of market power\".In a separate hearing, Facebook's head of cryptocurrency will answer questions from the Senate banking committee about Libra, the company's new digital payment system that has raised concerns on Capitol Hill.It is the latest example of mounting bipartisan hostility in an industry that could once do no wrong in American politics, and comes amid renewed attention from regulators that have historically treated it kindly.Last week the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reportedly approved a $5bn (£4bn) settlement with \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m over the Cambridge \u001b[43mAnalytica\u001b[0m scandal, while the FTC and US Justice Department are said to be considering competition inquiries of all four companies. \"We cannot allow giant companies to assert their power over critical public infrastructure,\" said Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Senate banking committee.\"The largest tech companies do not act in the interest of working Americans, but in the interest of themselves and their investors.\"Democrats who once praised Silicon Valley as a creator of skilled jobs have turned on it since the 2016 election, attacking its \u001b[43mrecord\u001b[0m on privacy, the role of its \u001b[43malgorithms\u001b[0m in public life and, increasingly, its sheer size.Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a plan to break up tech giants a key part of her campaign, arguing that Google, Amazon and Apple should not be allowed to run online marketplaces while simultaneously selling their own products through them. But Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, echoed her when he said: \"By almost any measure the giant tech companies are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil was when it was broken up. They're larger and more powerful than AT&amp;T when it was broken up.\"President Donald Trump has accused big tech of Left-wing bias, last week holding a \"social \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m summit\" that gathered his most prominent online supporters for what was regarded as early election rally.David Marcus, who leads Facebook's Libra project, pledged in written testimony that Libra will not compete with sovereign currencies and will not be launched until it had been approved by regulators.He also warned that if America failed to create a global digital currency it would be eclipsed by \"others whose values are dramatically different\" - a coded reference to Chinese companies such as WeChat, which has a built-in payments system.\n",

      "THE country's most senior judge risked a constitutional clash with Parliament yesterday after he attacked politicians who deliberately breached super-injunctions.Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, questioned whether it was a \"good idea\" for MPs and peers to \"flout\" a court order just because they disagreed with it.He also blamed the Human Rights \u001b[43mAct\u001b[0m for creating the issue over \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m rights and injunctions.A judicial review of injunctions suggested that journalists could be stopped from reporting cases that are raised in Parliament, jeopardising the 300-yearold principle of parliamentary privilege.Lord Judge spoke out after details of injunctions were revealed in the Commons and Lords, including that of Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland.An MP and a peer have used parliamentary privilege to disclose details of a gagging order despite the courts banning publication.But in a thinly-veiled criticism of the politicians' actions, Lord Judge told reporters yesterday: \"It is, of course, wonderful for you if a Member of Parliament stands up in Parliament and says something which in effect means an order of the court on anonymity is breached.\"But you do need to think, do you not, whether it's a very good idea for our \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m makers to be flouting a court order just because they disagree with it, or because they disagree with the \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m of \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m which Parliament has created.\"Lord Judge said he would meet the speakers of both the Commons and the Lords to discuss the issue.In a related move, the country's second most senior judge raised the prospect that journalists who report such comments could be in contempt of court. But Lord Neuberger, the Master of the Rolls, who chaired the year-long inquiry in to injunctions, said the \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m surrounding reports of parliamentary proceedings was \"astonishingly unclear\" and \"very unsatisfactory\".His report warned that there was \"no judicial decision\" on whether a report of material \"which intentionally had the effect of frustrating a court order would be in good faith and without malice\", and whether it would be covered by privilege.It added that where reporting did not attract privilege, \"it is unclear whether it would be protected at common \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m from contempt proceedings if it breached a court order\". Details of an injunction involving Sir Fred were raised in the Commons by the MP John Hemming then in the Lords on Thursday by Lord Stoneham.Mr Hemming said yesterday: \"This attempt to gag the \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m in discussing the proceedings in Parliament is, in my view, a retrograde step.\" John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m and sport select committee said \u001b[43mlegislation\u001b[0m should be considered \"urgently\" to ensure the \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m could report comments made in Parliament.\"At the end of the day, MPs are there to \u001b[43msafeguard\u001b[0m the public interest and if there is a clear public interest, they should be able to speak about that issue,\" he said.Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP, said: \"I do not think it is desirable or healthy for parliamentarians to abuse parliamentary privilege to break court injunctions.\"The judicial review follows concern that the rich and famous are increasingly censoring embarrassing stories through injunctions, including super-injunctions, where even the existence of an order cannot be publicised.The report accepted injunctions had \"sometimes been more widely used than is strictly necessary\" and admitted there could be some of which it was not aware. It also admitted concerns about a form of \"permanent secret justice\" creeping in. Under new rules for judges, the \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m would be told about injunctions and given \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m to hearings to contest them.David Cameron's spokesman said the Government would consider Lord Neuberger's report before deciding whether to \u001b[43mlegislate\u001b[0m on \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m issues.\n",

      "PORNOGRAPHIC websites are publicising loopholes in the ban on under-18 \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m as watchdogs admit they are powerless to stop tech-savvy teenagers circumventing the new restrictions.The regulator acknowledged that virtual private networks (VPNs) would allow users to evade age verification checks from July 15.These allow under-age users to create ghost accounts abroad that can \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m the porn sites.Although most VPNs require payment, MindGeek, the firm behind some of the world's largest porn sites, has already released its own free VPN service, VPNHub, which allows users to disguise their location.Last year, it advertised the service with the claim that it would let the \u001b[43muser\u001b[0m \"access all websites and apps securely and privately at home, school, work or from anywhere in the world\".Although the description has been changed, VPN Hub boasts on Apple's App Store that it can \"mask your true location by routing your \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m through our full stack of global encrypted servers\". The app is available via \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m and Apple stores, although MindGeek claimed it would not be available in UK app stores without age verification once the ban came into effect.Asked about the prospect of children using VPNs, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), the regulator, said age verification was no \"silver bullet\". A spokesman added: \"Determined teenagers will find ways to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m pornography. However, it will mean children can no longer stumble across it on commercial pornographic websites.\"Experts also warned that anyone using VPNs risked exploitation of their \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m data, as controls on \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m and commercial use tended to be lax. The Government estimates 1.4million children a month \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m porn sites.From July 15, anyone who visits such a site from a British IP address will be asked for proof that they are over 18. Proof is obtained via third-party age verification firms or cards that can be bought in shops for £4.99. Some fear the cards or codes from age verification firms are likely to end up being traded.The BBFC is to closely \u001b[43mmonitor\u001b[0m messaging and \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m sites such as Reddit, Tumblr and Flickr, which are not covered by the \u001b[43mlegislation\u001b[0m but provide a potential route for under-age users to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m porn to decide whether further \u001b[43mregulation\u001b[0m is needed.With 5million porn sites worldwide, the BBFC admits it can only focus on the most popular sites that flout the law, leaving smaller operations open for tech-savvy younger users. Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said he was worried about \"torrent\" filesharing sites, where people already download pirated films and porn. He said: \"These are semi-criminal operations that flout the \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m because they don't give a hoot. They are breaking the \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m anyway so they are not going to care about age verification.\"Myles Jackman, a lawyer and expert on pornography legislation, said: \"The community that is supposed to be most protected are the most tech literate and will be able to circumvent these rules.\"The BBFC said it would report in a year on the effectiveness of the regime.Editorial Comment: Page 17Getting round it How savvy surfers can dodge checksJoining virtual private networks that allow users to \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m porn sites as if they were overseas outside UK jurisdiction.Passing on 18-plus codes or cards that allow \u001b[43maccess\u001b[0m to sites.Sharing porn on messaging apps not covered by the law.Viewing porn on exempt \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m sites.Accessing pirate torrent video filesharing sites.Searching out sites that the regulator has failed to close down.\n",

      "Avoid the aubergine emojiIt's rudeDon't take a selfie with a flower crown filterSteer clear of memesThese are not meant for youWhen we look back on the last 10 years, I hope we will be kind. I hope we will remember what we were up against: phones that were smarter than us, apps that were funnier than us, speakers that listened more intently than us. I hope we will remember that we all thought it was a good idea to take pictures of our breakfast, send work emails at 11pm and have a public spat (in 140 characters) with a person called @Deathfish. Because in the absence of any formal, written rules, those of us born south of 1995 have all been winging it across the digital landscape, crossing our fingers that, one day, `the cloud' will simply disappear taking with it every bathroom-mirror selfie, Boomerang video and WhatsApp breakdown.But until that day comes, we have to fight back. We have to take charge. We have to reclaim the dignity we lost in 2017 when we accidentally posted an Instagram story from the inside of our handbag. We need some rules. And we need them now. So, consider this your basic guide: a few gentle parameters that allow us to keep pace with the times, while keeping our career and \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m status intact.1 \u001b[43mAct\u001b[0m your ageIt is very difficult to behave like an adult in the digital world. Unbidden emojis will slink into text messages. Out of the 75 ringtone options on your new smartphone, only one will not have a name like Tropical Dragon Beats. \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m will insist on speaking to you like you are a 13-year-old American highschool student (`Are you sure you want to shut down this window?'), while every platform presumes 300 characters can sum up a person's entire life work. But there are ways to flex your maturity. OK, not many. In fact, barely any. Options include, though are not limited to: putting your phone on vibrate. Seriously, it is the only option. Avoiding emoji use in all communication with colleagues or anyone over the age of 35. Swerving photo filters that insert flowers/halos/anything that looks vaguely sparkly or unicorn-like around your head. Ditching acronym-speech, no matter how much time it saves you over email. And leaving selfie sticks to Joe Wicks.2 Beware the emoji minefieldIt takes a brave adult to wade, uninitiated, into the emoji dashboard. Because this way lies trouble. To you or me, emojis may appear benign. Cute even, reminding us as they do of our childhood friend, Pac-Man. But they are not Pac-Man. Emojis are a different beast altogether. They are supposed to imbue text messages with emotion but instead are fraught with misinterpretation, secondary meaning and political implications. Kendall Jenner found this out when she used an emoji with a darker skin tone than her own and was slammed for cultural appropriation.You may find yourself in similar territory if you use the OK finger symbol when a colleague asks you if you want to go for lunch, not realising that according to some interpretations you have just given them the white power salute. And on the subject of white power: if you are Caucasian, it's usually best to stick to the `neutral' yellow emoji. For everything. Sure, there are specific `white' emojis for you but, I'll be honest, there's a certain squeamishness around asserting `whiteness' \u001b[43mright\u001b[0m now. Basically it's a total minefield. I mean, I'm mixed race and even I use the yellow emoji. Other problematic emojis that should be used with extreme caution are: the aubergine (unequivocally means penis); water drops with a hand in front (masturbation); applause hands (spanking); fire (you are seriously hot... although if used ironically, totally acceptable). The best course of action therefore is to avoid the emoji lexicon altogether. If you can't do that thenstick to the only three universally unambiguous ones: laughing face, smiley face and sad face. And if you really insist in dabbling further, then at least arm yourself with our guide below. And a good lawyer.3 Swerve the hashtag challengeThese seemingly innocuous hashtag challenges sprout up across our \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m feeds like wildflowers in the spring. Where did they come from? What do they mean? Why have I found myself doing exactly what they ask of me? Sadly, much like emojis, the hashtag challenge is not to be trusted. We now all know, for example, that the #icebucketchallenge was less about raising money for charity and more about showing the world how hard you'd been working out at the gym. The internet's latest attempt to have us all show the world what a bunch of raging narcissists we are is the #10YearChallenge. You're supposed to post a picture of yourself 10 years ago next to one of you now. This should then encourage the bunch of obsequious worms on your Instagram account to comment on how beautifully you have aged. It is a vanity trap. Do not fall into it. It's also, rumour has it, potentially a \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m nightmare, because if you believe the conspiracy theorists, it was just a massive facial-recognition data-gathering exercise for Facebook. I know, right? Can you believe \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m would pull a stunt like that? Essentially, the only mature way to partake (and this is a good rule for most things on \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m media) is to approach with irony. So, an image of you at 6am, at that moment just before you transform from vague, wrinkly human matter into fully recognisable human face thanks to Eve Lom's hot-cloth cleanser, will do just fine.4 Recognise where you are welcomeThere are certain platforms that welcome us as an old aunt might Myspace, Messenger, Tumblr. This is because, much like an old aunt, no one actually wants to hang out with them any more. And then there are platforms that greet us like an oligarch's minder Snapchat, Musical.ly, Instagram Stories. How do you know whether you're welcome or not? Easy. If every time you use said platform you end up throwing your phoneDid you really say that?What it appears to be: A pair of nice brown eyes. Can mean: Used with other emojis, this almost always means you're up to no good. Send it next to an aubergine (see opposite) and you're being highly suggestive.What it appears to be: A woman with her arms crossed. Can mean: Girl power.What it appears to be: A snowflake. Can mean: Cocaine.hat it appears to e: An explosive. an mean: `You're he bomb.'What it appears to be: Everything is OK. Can mean: `White power.'What it appears to be: A manicure. Can mean: `Not bothered.'What it appears to be: A snake, possibly a cobra. Can mean: A treacherous or untrustworthy person.What it appears to be: An upside-down smiley face. Can mean: Ever needed to be nice to someone despite hating them? That.What it appears to be: A palm of a hand. Can mean: `What-ever.'What it appears to be: An aubergine. Can mean: A penis.What it appears to be: A peach. Can mean: A juicy bottom.What it appears to be: Shocked face. Can mean: Oral sex for men.What it appears to be: A stickingout tongue. Can mean: Oral sex for women.across the room and shouting, `BUT HOW DOES IT WORK? HOW, TELL ME, HOW?' then it's not for you. In fact, rumour has it Snapchat deliberately makes its interface almost impossible to use unless you are a 14-year-old wizard with doublejointed thumbs in order to keep people like us out of there.You may think joining these platforms anonymously is the thing to do, but everyone hates a `lurking egg' (someone who floats through \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m with an \u001b[43manonymous\u001b[0m biography and contributes nothing but the occasional `like'). Best to view such apps like a party you were not invited to. You wouldn't have fun even if you did turn up... because no one, absolutely no one, wants you there.5 Observe basic mannersJust because Amazon's Alexa doesn't have any manners doesn't mean you don't need any, either. Repeat after us... Phones should not make it on to tabletops in meetings or out for dinner with a loved one. And if they do get that far, they should always be screen down. Work emails, even if meant for the following day, should not be sent outside work hours. Sending it instead on WhatsApp also isn't acceptable. And while we know you'd love to \u001b[43mshare\u001b[0m your holiday experience/dinner/train journey with your entire extended family, doing a running commentary on MAXIMUM VOLUME on FaceTime is strictly prohibited under all circumstances. (Seriously: I once ate dinner in a restaurant next to a man who spent the entire meal FaceTiming some poor sod on the other end who had to listen to him give a fork-by-fork breakdown of his meal like he wasGordon bloody Ramsay. And he had only ordered a burger and chips!) FaceTime is for the \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m of your own home. Please remember that. Other no-gos include \u001b[43mtagging\u001b[0m people in pictures they did not approve/have time to filter; posting pictures of other people's children; sliding into someone's DMs (direct messages) unannounced; using someone's Instagram picture without the hashtag #regram and an ode to how fabulous the person behind said image is. Using the phrase `Netflix and chill'. With anyone. Ever.6 Climb the status hierarchyWhether you like it or not there exists a clearly defined \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m hierarchy in the online world. Those with a blue tick across any \u001b[43msocial\u001b[0m \u001b[43mmedia\u001b[0m platform get top billing. This is because a blue tick usually means they are a) famous, and b) winning at life a lot more than you. If a `blue ticker' (new term, just made it up also fine to do in the digital world) follows you, the etiquette is to follow them back. Even if just for de-facto status points. It's also no longer about your number of followers (never call them your `audience' please), but how much you interact with them. So even if you only have 27 followers, 10 of whom are close family members but with whom you `engage' every day about the best way to get rid of trapped wind, you are technically an `IBS micro-influencer'. Finally, a word on `status' email addresses. CEOs, celebrities and people who are usually going somewhere in life all have their own `domain name'. This is your unique internet \u001b[43midentity\u001b[0m and can be used to create a very professional-sounding email such as jeffbezos@jeffbezos.com (never tried it... might work). If that all feels a bit heavy on the narcissism to you, then use this simple rule of thumb: Gmail is the hippest form of all email addresses. Outlook is fine; nothing more, nothing less. Yahoo and BTinternet accounts are the fleecelined slippers of email addresses: practical, comfortable, but not to be seen in public. And if you're still operating with a Hotmail address, I have only one thing to say: WTF?Do not use the phrase `NAggravating abbreviations and acronymsRanked in order of annoyance, according to a definitive poll around the Telegraph officesCray (Crazy) Jelly (Jealous) Adorbs (Adorable) Soz (Sorry) Hun (Honey)FFS (For f--'s sake: especially when accompanying a `lazy' retweet, ie a retweet without a comment) DH (Darling husband)LO (Little one) DD1 and DD2 (Dearest daughter one and dearest daughter two) Brill (Brilliant) Perf (Perfect)Awks (Awkward) AIBU (Am I being unreasonable?)

      "The Daily Telegraph's powerful story of \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m gathering on millions of people worldwide and thousands in the UK is a wake-up call.In China, the Communist state is beginning to use Big \u001b[43mData\u001b[0m and artificial intelligence (AI) to build a \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m state the like of which the world has not seen before. This story is evidence that China is beginning to export that \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m state to the rest of the world.In the last few years, many nations have been coming to terms with an uncomfortable truth: the China we hoped for is not the China we're getting.Sadly, we in the UK are years behind allies such as Australia, Japan and the US in our understanding of what is happening.This story raises questions over \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m \u001b[43mcollection\u001b[0m and suggests that private firms with links to the state are gathering \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m on millions of people throughout the world.This is following a pattern of mass \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m gathering, either by legally scraping and compiling \u001b[43mdatabases\u001b[0m as done by Zhenhua or by hacking.So for example, in 2014 and 2015, Chinese hackers stole sensitive \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m on 21million US federal employees, one of the largest \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m \u001b[43mbreaches\u001b[0m in US history. In 2019, the US Government forced a Chinese firm that bought Grindr to relinquish control, over fears that Beijing would use ownership of the gay dating site for blackmail purposes. That decision, by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, shows that Chinese \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m gathering on individuals is now seen in the US as a national \u001b[43msecurity\u001b[0m issue.As well as the UK, this \u001b[43mdatabase\u001b[0m focused on India, a neighbour and potential rival, where China charts politicians down to very low levels of government, and defence staff. In Australia, it appears to be particularly interested in the children of senior politicians and business people. China does not build \u001b[43mdatabases\u001b[0m on us, legally or not, for benign reasons or to know when to send birthday cards. It does this to find human vulnerabilities to exploit. If \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m are power, that is what China is building.For sure, China's \u001b[43msurveillance\u001b[0m state isn't the only threat to our \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m or data. Western tech giants are not perfect. The \u001b[43mlaws\u001b[0m governing them are too lax: \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m and \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m both monetise private \u001b[43minformation\u001b[0m on the internet. However, the Western tech giants operate under our \u001b[43mlaws\u001b[0m and reflect, broadly, our values. Unlike China, \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m doesn't run concentration camps for ethnic minorities; \u001b[43mFacebook\u001b[0m isn't arresting activists in Hong Kong; and Amazon isn't threatening Taiwan or seeking to intimidate the UK Government. Our Government needs a wake-up call to understand the new world we live in, in which not only China but also Russia threaten to use new technology and renewed forms of state competition to assert their interests and neo-authoritarian views.These countries, like all authoritarian states, see liberal democracy as a threat because our politicians are beholden to the people, and not the other way around.Companies that \u001b[43mcollect\u001b[0m and store \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m on UK citizens in \u001b[43mbreach\u001b[0m of the \u001b[43mGDPR\u001b[0m should be sued. Investment in the UK by Chinese companies, purchase of UK hi-tech firms and participation in university projects in sensitive areas such as Big Data, AI or \u001b[43mfacial\u001b[0m and other forms of recognition, should be more carefully scrutinised, using clear public interest guidelines.In tightening this oversight, we are doing no more than catching up with allies such as Germany, Australia and the US. Working with our allies, we need a coherent, measured but robust response to the threat of new authoritarianism, both in the physical and virtual worlds.Bob Seely is the Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight'Working with our allies, we need a coherent, measured but robust response to the threat of authoritarianism'\n",

      "Countries around the world have been locked in a race to roll out smartphone apps that \u001b[43mtrack\u001b[0m and trace coronavirus. The UK, however, is falling behind on its efforts. Downing Street said yesterday that its app will launch nationwide in the \"coming weeks\", despite Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, suggesting it would be rolled out in mid-May.Rather than using a model proposed by tech giants Apple and Google, the UK is pressing ahead with an app developed by NHSX, the NHS's digital innovation arm. The technology, which relies on Bluetooth signals, has been downloaded about 60,000 times during a pilot on the Isle of Wight.If two phones with the app meet, they perform a digital handshake. If one \u001b[43muser\u001b[0m later self-reports coronavirus symptoms, they upload these on the to the UK with technology that proponents say offers greater \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m than the British or Singapore systems.A match between two phones is only ever recorded on the devices, and if one person takes a test that is positive for coronavirus, it alerts other users directly to their phone. The app, Corona-Warn-App, uses a protocol developed by Apple and Google, based on the decentralised approach. The NHS has pushed back against a decentralised system.Switzerland The Swiss have pushed ahead with a fully open-source approach developed by several leading European \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m experts. This format is called D3PT and is expected to go into full trials this week. The decentralised system requires users to log \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m from a positive coronavirus test in order to alert matches who have connected over Bluetooth.Norway and Iceland Some developers have decided that adding GPS data, marking your location, is more useful for \u001b[43mtracking\u001b[0m coronavirus than Bluetooth alone. Apple, \u001b[43mGoogle\u001b[0m and the UK's efforts do not \u001b[43mcollect\u001b[0m GPS data.Norway's app \u001b[43mcollects\u001b[0m \u001b[43manonymous\u001b[0m GPS and Bluetooth data. Iceland's app, Rakning C-19, meanwhile, just relies on GPS \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m for contact-tracing and has been downloaded by 40pc of people on the island.China arguably has the most invasive and most comprehensive approaches to contact-tracing. Its technology relies on self-reporting and proximity contact-tracing. Users must upload \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m such as their national ID number, passport \u001b[43mdata\u001b[0m and phone number. People scan in QR codes, and can also upload their temperature, on mobile phones as they enter or leave buildings or shops. Users are then given red, yellow or green colour codes which determine whether they can travel or even go outside.What it means for the UK With so many different systems being piloted, is the UK's going to be most effective? Experts are not certain. \"I don't think a perfect approach exists,\" says Enza Iannopollo, a technology analyst at Forrester, \"but the UK has not followed the most \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m preserving approach.\"Other experts point out that an app can only ever complement manual tracing. \"Look at South Korea,\" says Aidan Peppin of the Ada Lovelace Institute. \"The reason they have been so successful is their manual effort has been huge.\"app to an NHS server, which warns people they have come into contact with. But what could the UK learn from efforts elsewhere in the world? Singapore was among the first countries to implement digital contact-tracing. Its TraceTogether app, which launched in March, has provided the blueprint for several nations' own efforts.However, the Bluetooth it uses has caused some technical issues. For instance, on iPhones, the app has to be open at all times, which is a drain on the battery. It can sometimes fail to \u001b[43mrecord\u001b[0m encounters between iPhones and devices running Google's Android system. The NHS app also relies on Bluetooth. Just over a million people have downloaded the app, some way off the 50pc or more needed to make it effective.Germany has taken a different course\n",

      "The internet is \"out of control\" in breaking injunctions, but it is still more important that court orders target the established media, senior judges said yesterday.Lord Neuberger, the Master of the Rolls, admitted that bloggers and users of websites such as Twitter would not necessarily be covered by court orders, even though some \"peddle lies\".But he rejected claims that the situation made injunctions futile because the internet had \"by no means the same degree of \u001b[43mintrusion\u001b[0m into \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m as the story being emblazoned on the front pages of newspapers\", which \"people trust more\".The effectiveness of injunctions has been questioned after the alleged identities of many of those who have obtained one were published on Twitter.However, Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said that society should consider other ways to control Twitter and other sites, rather than leaving at their mercy those who had a genuine need for privacy.\"Anybody can put anything on it,\" he said. \"Modern technology is totally out of control.\" But he added: \"I'm not giving up on the possibility that people who peddle lies about others through using technology may one day be brought under control, maybe through damages, very substantial damages, maybe even injunctions.\"Tom Whitehead\n",

      "ANDY COULSON, the former editor of the News of the World, was behind sting operations aimed at coercing celebrities into disclosing details of their private lives, the Leveson Inquiry heard yesterday.Steve Coogan, the comedian, writer and actor, said he had twice been the subject of such tactics when Mr Coulson was a senior executive at the nowdefunct Sunday tabloid.The inquiry into press ethics, which was set up in the wake of the News of the World hacking scandal, was hearing a second day of evidence from alleged victims of press intrusion.Mr Coogan told Lord Justice Leveson that the first incident, allegedly orchestrated by Mr Coulson, occurred in August 2002.He said he received a phone call from Rav Singh, a News of the World reporter who was a casual friend. The journalist told him that he was about to receive a phone call from a young woman, but to be careful what he said because it was a \"set-up\".Mr Coogan told the inquiry: \"There was a girl in Andy Coulson's office who was going to speak to me. The phone call would be recorded, and she would try to entice me into talking about intimate details of my life.\"I was told by Rav Singh that Andy Coulson would be listening to the call and that I would have to obfuscate without betraying the fact that I knew I was being set up so I didn't land him in it as having tipped me off.\"Mr Coogan said on that occasion the set-up failed but he again became a target in April 2004 during a period when his relationship was breaking down because of an affair.He explained that he had again received a phone call from Mr Singh, who told him that the newspaper was planning to run a story about the affair.\"I sort of begged him not to put in some of the more lurid details of the story, and he said if I confirmed certain aspects of the story, in return he would guarantee that the more lurid detail would be left out,\" said Mr Coogan. \"So I confirmed certain details for him and he gave me his word that the more embarrassing parts of the story, which I knew would upset my then wife's family, would be omitted.\"But he said that shortly afterwards his manager received a call from Mr Coulson saying that the entire conversation had been recorded and the newspaper was planning to run it. He said Mr Singh's role had been a ruse to get him to speak.Mr Coulson took over as editor of the News of the World in 2002 but stepped down in 2007 following the jailing of the paper's royal editor, Clive Goodman, for illegally intercepting voicemails.Mr Coulson went on to become David Cameron's director of communications but resigned from the post in January this year, amid increasing pressure over his alleged role in the phone hacking affair.He is currently on police bail after being arrested in July this year in connection with allegations of corruption and phone hacking.Mr Coogan admitted that his colourful private life meant he had been the subject of a number of \"kiss and tell\" stories, but said he had never set out to be a \"paragon of virtue\" or \"model of morality\". \"I never sought fame,\" he told the inquiry. \"Fame is a by-product of what I do.\"He said he did not believe that the coverage about him had been a \"malicious \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m vendetta\" but said where the tabloid press were concerned \"it's like the Mafia, it's just business\".Mr Coogan said he had also been the subject of inaccurate articles, including one piece in the Daily Mail that stated that Courtney Love, a former lover, was responsible for the attempted suicide of Owen Wilson, the American actor.He said when he had attempted to seek corrections or damages the system had been \"unwieldy\" and expensive adding: \"It is sometimes as effective to do nothing. It's also cheaper.\"Mr Coogan called for a shake-up in press \u001b[43mregulation\u001b[0m but said he did not want to see quality journalism stifled. \"I wish the press were able to regulate themselves. I would like that,\" he said. \"But they have been given opportunities and have failed. There needs to be a \u001b[43mprivacy\u001b[0m \u001b[43mlaw\u001b[0m so that genuine publicinterest journalism is not besmirched by this tawdry muck-raking.\"Referring to Hugh Grant's appearance earlier in the week, Mr Coogan said: \"It's not the Steve and Hugh show. We're here, and not with great enthusiasm, because somebody has to represent all those other people who haven't the stomach to be here.\"Of course there's a \u001b[43mpersonal\u001b[0m element to it, but it's not just about us; it's about other people.\"Earlier in the day, Garry Flitcroft, the former Blackburn Rovers footballer, told the inquiry that reporting of his private life may have contributed to his father's suicide.In 2002, he lost a legal battle to stop the People publishing stories of extramarital affairs. Mr Flitcroft said his father stopped watching him play because the crowds' chanting was so bad - worsening his depression.\"I never set out to be a paragon of virtue or a model of morality\n",
