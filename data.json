Some say that is the way it should be; others think it should be easier.Internet law specialist Rick Shera, partner at Auckland firm LowndesJordan, said Kiwis had some privacy protection, but the internet was hard to police.\"In a sense we already have a right to be forgotten. We have the Privacy Act, which says you can only keep information as long as is necessary given the purpose it was collected for.\"Google, Facebook and other social platforms have terms of use that allow complaints about content. But they can be hard to reach.Shera felt the Harmful Digital Communications Bill currently before Parliament, while largely targeted at cyber-bullying, might make removal easier.\"Sometimes it's quite difficult to navigate your way through the labyrinth to find the right way to get material removed,\" he said.The bill will empower an agency to receive and deal with complaints about harmful material on the internet.Google also fields requests from police, and complies with court orders to remove content, which it publishes in its Transparency Report.In the six months to June last year, four New Zealand court orders were issued asking the world's most popular search engine to take down links and documents.Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said any response from Google to the decision might be implemented here.Telecommunications Users Association chief executive Paul Brislen said if the information was true, people should not be able to have it removed.\"If it's accurate information, I don't think you have a right to have it taken down, and I don't think you should have.\"The European Court ruling was odd as it focused on search engines, which did not hold the content being objected to, only the means to search it out, he said.Shera said the decision was \"beautiful in its vagueness\".\"It says people in certain circumstances have a right to be forgotten, but it doesn't give a great deal of guidance as to what those circumstances are . . . who decides that? How does it get put into place? It's a really big question.\""}, "USA_2205": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Parents fret that Alexa is listening;When kids are involved, privacy is a concern You're cool chatting up Amazon Alexa, the Google Assistant and Siri and having each come alive when you utter the \"Alexa,\" \"Hey, Google\" or \"Hey, Siri\" wake words.But your kids also are engaging with the popular digital voices inside the smart speakers in your home and your big concern has mostly to do with privacy.That's the chief takeaway from a new study, exclusive to USA TODAY and conducted in February, by Common Sense Media and SurveyMonkey Audience.More than 4 in 10 of the 1,127 parents of children ages 2 to  8 who participated in the survey say their family uses a smart speaker such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home. Nearly 6 in 10 say their young children interact with a voice-activated assistant such as Siri or Alexa.And 58 percent of parents whose kids use the smart speakers think it is at least moderately likely that someone could hack those speakers and listen in to their conversations. As a result, 40 percent have turned off their smart speaker's microphone to prevent it from listening.The eavesdropping concerns are not entirely unfounded.You need only rewind to last May when stories emerged about an Oregon family whose private conversations were recorded by their Amazon Echo smart speaker and emailed to a random phone contact.Amazon confirmed the incident at the time, and no, it wasn't a malicious hack. Alexa triggered the action after hearing an unforeseen combination of random words in a conversation the family didn't realize was being overheard.It's important to recognize that while Alexa may be listening for its wake word, it is not constantly recording.But when Amazon's assistant does wake up, that's when what it hears is sent to the company's cloud servers, where your words are recorded and translated into commands. Alexa also keeps a record of all the commands you've given it so that it can better learn how to answer you.A whopping 93 percent of parents in the SurveyMonkey poll who use such voice-activated devices say it is important to know when their family's voices are being recorded.An equal number said it's important to control whatever information is collected about them. Nearly as many want to control whether the family's voice data is being used to deliver more targeted ads.Run privacy checkups\"This report is a clarion call for tech companies and privacy regulators, that as these devices are brought into the home, there's nearly unanimous concern about privacy,\" said James P. Steyer,  CEO of Common Sense Media.\"Until privacy regulations are worked out, parents should turn off their home assistant's microphone when they're not using it and do regular privacy checks to maintain their comfort level with these devices.\"You can visit settings on Amazon's website to review your Alexa voice history, and listen to and delete any stored recordings.

The prime minister also confirmed that he advised Barclay to co-operate with police in their investigation of the recording, which may have been illegal.But Barclay chose to ignore that advice. His denials about taping Dickson unravelled after English was forced to produce his statement to police confirming that Barclay admitted to him he had recorded her criticising him.Texts from English to the former Clutha-Southland chairman suggested that Dickson's payout was larger than normal due to the privacy breach.Police investigated the incident for 10 months but closed the file after Barclay refused to co-operate, despite stating publicly that he would. They have now reopened the file after Barclay accepted English's evidence.English produced the police statement on Tuesday after earlier telling reporters he could not recall who told him about Dickson being taped.English was asked three times yesterday if he had advised Barclay to wipe the recording, and on the first two occasions appeared not to want to answer.He initially responded: \"I'm not going to comment on any of that.

It is sufficiently powerful that it will only be used at defence and security-services levels, for the foreseeable future.Chief executive of Penten Matthew Wilson says while AltoCrypt Stik will not be imminently rolled out to business users, the community of SMEs in the defence industry needs its own cyber-secure platform.\"We have this wave of defence procurement coming through, and a government determined to build sovereign capability around local industry and technology,\" says Wilson, referring to the $195 billion investment in defence. \"But we have to step back and understand the environment: the defence industry is not normal commerce. If you're in a defence industry supply chain, your adversaries are well resourced and highly motivated state actors, and their one job is to get inside your systems and access your data. It's not a fair fight.\"Australia's defence industry includes up to 3000 SMEs, most of which do not specialise in cyber security.\"Many SMEs who could be active in defence industry are experts in a niche,\" says Wilson.\"They design things, they cut and weld things. When they're getting into defence industry, they often don't know where their data is stored or who has access to it.\"Australia is in the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence-sharing arrangement with the US, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. While it confers strategic benefits on Australia, it raises Australia's profile as a source of defence secrets that attracts intelligence adversaries. To accommodate this, the Commonwealth's ICT security arrangements are tough - in many cases tougher than SMEs can bear.Cyber security has taken on an importance beyond the intrusive and expensive scourge of hacking and ransomware, says the global head of cyber at JLT Group, Sarah Stephens. \"The British government is committing around \u00a35 billion ($9 billion) to a cyber security program around government, intelligence, essential services and defence. It's an investment in making government more secure, making businesses more secure and enhancing training, and deception technologies.\"Stephens - who is London-based - says the effort to create a sovereign defence industry in Australia brings the cyber vulnerabilities of the business world into the realm of government and defence security.\"Australia's government, intelligence and defence systems are well locked down. But when you bring so many companies into your defence industry supply chain, there is going to be variation in the quality of cyber security systems and processes.\"She says in the past two years Australian businesses have matured in their approach to cyber security.

Those companies are skittish about government regulation generally. Civil liberties advocates, meanwhile, warn against excessive information-gathering by the government in the name of computer security.And members of Congress are wary of taking any steps that could infuriate the Internet industry, along with legions of newly politicized Web users, who won a surprise victory against two proposed anti-piracy laws in the United States last month: the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House of Representatives; and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA, in the Senate.Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California, who recently introduced a computer security bill, acknowledged that Washington had learned some lessons about the new political muscle of technology companies and their users. ''One of the things we learned is that we have to raise the debate such that no one believes things are being done behind closed doors,'' Mr. Lungren said by telephone.A congressional aide, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, put the lessons of the U.S. anti-piracy efforts more bluntly. Some members, the aide said, ''were kind of scarred by that experience and don't want to go down any road where they are viewed as regulating the Internet.''In fact, the latest network security bills being considered in Washington do not regulate the Internet, and it is not clear whether they will get much attention from the public.The Senate computer security bill is expected to be introduced as early as Friday by Joseph I. Lieberman, Susan M. Collins and John D. Rockefeller IV. It would give the Department of Homeland Security regulatory authority over essential services companies if attacks on them could jeopardize human life or U.S. national security. It would compel critical infrastructure companies and government agencies to share information about threats and breaches and would give the government power to impose sanctions on companies that ran afoul of the law.Details of the bill are still being negotiated. A hearing on it is scheduled for next week.The House of Representatives version of the bill, which Mr. Lungren proposed in December and is expected to go before a full committee in coming weeks, would allow Homeland Security to lay out performance standards for security but does not give it explicit powers to regulate.Kevin Richards, vice president for government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents large contractors of the U.S. government like Lockheed Martin, said members of the group were wary about being told what to do by the U.S. government. ''When it comes to the tech community and Capitol Hill, we look at two cardinal rules,'' Mr. Richards said. ''First is, 'Do no harm.' Second is, 'Beware unintended consequences.'''The U.S. government, he suggested, would do better to focus on improving its own security. ''It's important for our community to remain flexible and nimble in how we respond to the evolving cyberthreat,'' he said. ''The government should lead by example, when it comes to securing its network.''Neither the private sector nor government agencies have been immune to attacks in the United States. Large government contractors like Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton have suffered from embarrassing intrusions in the past year, as have RSA, the security division of EMC, and the F.B.I.Security researchers have repeatedly pointed to holes in the way industrial systems are protected, including those that handle power grids and oil rigs. The vulnerabilities are all the more worrisome, as more and more of these systems are connected to the Internet. Passwords can be weak. Data can be transmitted without encryption. Hackers can remotely turn machines on and off or tweak critical processes by adjusting valves.''Failure to properly control or restrict access to these elements can lead to catastrophic accidents,'' Paul Ferguson, a researcher with TrendMicro, a security firm, concluded recently in a blog post on his company's site.The best-known computer attack on an industrial system used a computer worm called Stuxnet and appears to have been aimed at Iran's nuclear weapons program. Some evidence suggests that it was a joint project of the United States and Israel.James A. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization based in Washington, worried that lobbying would produce a watered-down law that would do little to deter attacks.''The ideology of the market that dominates American politics, that government 'is the problem,' puts us at a disadvantage, because it's certainly not true for defense,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''A weak bill guarantees a hit.''The administration of President Barack Obama has been nudging Congress to act on digital security, an issue that seems to garner rare bipartisan energy.James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, told a rare open hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that ''market incentives'' had kept both the private and public sector from being able to keep up with increasingly sophisticated online attackers. ''Cyberthreats pose a critical national and economic security concern,'' he said in testimony.One of the sticking points in any U.S. security legislation is likely to be who can look at the information that private industry discloses about its own vulnerabilities and breaches. The intelligence community is eager to have access to such information. Others are eager to keep it out of their reach.One civil liberties group in Washington warned that companies and their customers might become worked up if they discovered that intelligence agencies were trying to extract as much information as possible in the name of security.''I think there is a risk in moving too fast to authorize sharing of so much information that it puts privacy at risk and upsets a lot of the same people who spoke out'' against the anti-piracy legislation, said Gregory T.

Most large firms have practice groups devoted to data security, and so do many smaller ones, fuelling the competition.\"It has grown exponentially in the past five years, and the landscape has become quite competitive,\" said Scott Vernick, a partner at Fox Rothschild who focuses on privacy, data security, and litigation.\"When I started doing this 10 years ago, I had trouble convincing people that this was something to pay attention to.\"\"Today, any self-respecting firm has a group.\"A series of high-profile data breaches -notably the huge loss of records by Target and the attack by hackers on Sony, exposing sensitive internal emails -have raised awareness. Forty-seven states now have laws requiring that customers be notified when breaches occur, and setting standards to protect data.For any entity that stores confidential customer data, the cost of a breach can be enormous. Jordan Rand, a lawyer at Dilworth Paxson in Philadelphia who focuses on data breaches and related insurance disputes, estimates that companies pay on average $300 for every record compromised. That's the cost of detection, notification of consumers, restoration of records, legal representation, and other actions.That high cost has spawned a new market in insurance coverage for companies looking to protect themselves.Rand works with Reclamere, a firm near State College, Pa., that helps companies protect their computer systems from breaches and gives assistance if hackers have gained access.Health care records are particularly vulnerable because hospitals, physician practice groups, and other providers are not as far along as financial-services companies in securing data and because health-care records are so valuable, experts say. A typical patient file might include not only Social Security numbers, but also credit-card and health-insurance information, and medical records.Breaches often involve sophisticated hacking techniques that, because they change frequently, are hard to stop.

This story is evidence that China is beginning to export that surveillance state to the rest of the world.In the last few years, many nations have been coming to terms with an uncomfortable truth: the China we hoped for is not the China we're getting.Sadly, we in the UK are years behind allies such as Australia, Japan and the US in our understanding of what is happening.This story raises questions over data collection and suggests that private firms with links to the state are gathering data on millions of people throughout the world.This is following a pattern of mass data gathering, either by legally scraping and compiling databases as done by Zhenhua or by hacking.So for example, in 2014 and 2015, Chinese hackers stole sensitive information on 21million US federal employees, one of the largest data breaches in US history. In 2019, the US Government forced a Chinese firm that bought Grindr to relinquish control, over fears that Beijing would use ownership of the gay dating site for blackmail purposes. That decision, by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, shows that Chinese data gathering on individuals is now seen in the US as a national security issue.As well as the UK, this database focused on India, a neighbour and potential rival, where China charts politicians down to very low levels of government, and defence staff. In Australia, it appears to be particularly interested in the children of senior politicians and business people. China does not build databases on us, legally or not, for benign reasons or to know when to send birthday cards. It does this to find human vulnerabilities to exploit. If data and information are power, that is what China is building.For sure, China's surveillance state isn't the only threat to our privacy or data. Western tech giants are not perfect. The laws governing them are too lax: Google and Facebook both monetise private information on the internet. However, the Western tech giants operate under our laws and reflect, broadly, our values.

Investment in the UK by Chinese companies, purchase of UK hi-tech firms and participation in university projects in sensitive areas such as Big Data, AI or facial and other forms of recognition, should be more carefully scrutinised, using clear public interest guidelines.In tightening this oversight, we are doing no more than catching up with allies such as Germany, Australia and the US.

She also claims that policies have since been changed, but institutions caught doing wrong routinely say this, and the assurances mean little or nothing.Only time will tell whether the board has really changed.The incident suggests that the board wanted to put some of the blame for Samuel Fischer's suicide on his mother, and in the attempt to do so broke its fundamental obligations of privacy.What actually happened while the young man was in the hospital's care is hotly disputed, especially the issue of Samuel's access and a $20,000 card debt that was causing him anguish on the day of his death.It is regrettable that no neutral authority seems likely to investigate these claims and counterclaims.But one thing remains clear enough. Samuel died after he was committed to the secure unit. He was clearly a risk to himself.In those conditions, the patient has been deprived of his liberty and his safety is entirely the responsibility of the board.The DHB failed to keep him safe, and it's hard to see how it can escape the charge of dereliction of duty.This was not a suicide by someone in an open unit, where all can agree that the issue of care and control is necessarily fraught.The board must know that it is vulnerable in this matter, and it should not have tried to pin some of the blame on Samuel's mother.This goes beyond the issue of privacy and suggests a deeper fault.Green MP Kevin Hague says the board's email was \"callous and cruel\" and wonders why Debbie Chin still has her job.These remarks might be dismissed as mere politicking but for the fact that Hague himself was a DHB chief executive on the West Coast.His question deserves an answer."}, "AFR_1854": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Rules risk entrenching giants;Comment Requiring customers of digital businesses to opt in to the collection and sharing of personal information, as the competition regulator has recommended, would hurt Australia's burgeoning online marketplace start-ups and entrench the advantage of Facebook and Google, a leading lawyer says.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Monday released its long-awaited preliminary report on digital platforms, and made 11 recommendations aimed at providing checks and balances to the outsized market power of Facebook and Google.One recommendation contained several suggested changes to the Privacy Act, including the right to have all consumers' data erased by a platform once their consent to use it has been withdrawn, but also toughening the rules for getting that consent in the first place.The definition of consent in the act should be amended to \"require express, opt-in consent and incorporate requirements into the Australian Privacy Principles that consent must be adequately informed (including about the consequences of providing consent), voluntarily given, current and specific,\" the ACCC recommended.\"This means that settings that enable data collection must be preselected to 'off'.\" This would render the products of many Australian start-ups unusable, according to a lawyer in LegalVision's IT and online team, James Adler.\"If you're trying to connect a buyer and a seller, by definition you need informa- tion on both those parties,\" Mr Adler said.The sign-up processes to most online services have hitherto been, as the ACCC points out, \"clickwrap\" affairs where consent to have personal information collected and shared is bundled into a \"take it or leave it\" agreement that also grants access to the service itself.\"Clients have shown me metrics where the drop-out rates related to one extra click are astounding.

Now, the digital dragnet is expanding beyond Xinjiang's residents, ensnaring tourists, traders and other visitors - and digging deep into their smartphones.A team of journalists from The New York Times and other publications examined a policing app used in the region, getting a rare look inside the intrusive technologies that China is deploying in the name of quelling Islamic radicalism and strengthening Communist Party rule in its Far West. The use of the app has not been previously reported.China's border authorities routinely install the app on smartphones belonging to travelers who enter Xinjiang by land from Central Asia, according to several people interviewed by the journalists who crossed the border recently and requested anonymity to avoid government retaliation. Chinese officials also installed the app on the phone of one of the journalists during a recent border crossing. Visitors were required to turn over their devices to be allowed into Xinjiang.The app gathers personal data from phones, including text messages and contacts. It also checks whether devices are carrying pictures, videos, documents and audio files that match any of more than 73,000 items included on a list stored within the app's code.Those items include Islamic State publications, recordings of jihadi anthems and images of executions. But they also include material without any connection to Islamic terrorism, an indication of China's heavy-handed approach to stopping extremist violence. There are scanned pages from an Arabic dictionary, recorded recitations of Quran verses, a photo of the Dalai Lama and even a song by a Japanese band of the earsplitting heavy-metal style known as grindcore.\"The Chinese government, both in law and practice, often conflates peaceful religious activities with terrorism,\" Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said. \"You can see in Xinjiang, privacy is a gateway right: Once you lose your right to privacy, you're going to be afraid of practicing your religion, speaking what's on your mind or even thinking your thoughts.\"The United States has condemned Beijing for the crackdown in Xinjiang, which Chinese officials defend as a nonlethal way of fighting terrorism. The region is home to many of the country's Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group, and the Chinese government has blamed Islamic extremism and Uighur separatism for deadly attacks on Chinese targets.In the past few years, China has placed hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslims in re-education camps in Xinjiang. For the region's residents, police checkpoints and surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology have imbued life with a corrosive fear of acting out of turn. With the scanning of phones at the border, the Chinese government is applying similarly invasive monitoring techniques to people who do not even live in Xinjiang or China. Beijing has said that terrorist groups use Central Asian countries as staging grounds for attacks in China. Three people who crossed the Xinjiang land border from Kyrgyzstan in the past year said that as part of a lengthy inspection, Chinese border officials had demanded that visitors unlock and hand over their handsets and computers. On Android devices, officers installed an app called Fengcai (pronounced \"FUNG-tsai\"), a name that evokes bees collecting pollen.A copy of Fengcai was examined by journalists from The New York Times; the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung; the German broadcaster NDR; The Guardian; and Motherboard, the Vice Media technology site. One of the journalists undertook the border crossing in recent months. Holders of Chinese passports, including members of the majority Han ethnic group, had their phones checked as well, the journalist said.Apple devices were not spared scrutiny. Visitors' iPhones were unlocked and connected via a USB cable to a hand-held device, the journalist said. What the device did could not be determined.The journalists also asked researchers at the Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany and the Open Technology Fund, an initiative funded by the United States government under Radio Free Asia, to analyze the code of the Android app, Fengcai. The Open Technology Fund then requested and funded an assessment of the app by Cure53, a cybersecurity company in Berlin. The app's simple design makes the inspection process easy for border officers to carry out. After Fengcai  is installed on a phone, the researchers found, it gathers all stored text messages, call records, contacts and calendar entries, as well as information about the device itself. The app also checks the files on the phone against the list of more than 73,000 items. This list contains only the size of each file and a code that serves as a unique signature. It does not include the files' names or other information that would indicate what they are.But at the journalists' request, researchers at the Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group based at the University of Toronto, obtained information about roughly 1,400 of the files by comparing their signatures with ones stored by VirusTotal, a malware-scanning service owned by the Google sibling company Chronicle. Additional files were identified by Vinny Troia, the founder of the cybersecurity firm NightLion Security, and York Yannikos of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Darmstadt, Germany.Most of the files that the journalists could identify were related to Islamic terrorism: Islamic State recruitment materials in several languages, books written by jihadi figures, information about how to derail trains and build homemade weapons.Many of the files were more benign. There were audio recordings of Quran verses recited by well-known clerics, the sort of material that many practicing Muslims might have on their phones. There were books about Arabic language and grammar, and a copy of \"The Syrian Jihad,\" a book about the country's civil war by the researcher Charles R. Lister.Mr. Lister said he did not know why the Chinese authorities might consider him or his book suspicious. He speculated that it might only be because the word \"jihad\" was in the title.Other files the app scans for have no link to Islam or Islamic extremism. There are writings by the Dalai Lama, whom China considers a dangerous separatist, and a photograph of him. There is a summary of \"The 33 Strategies of War,\" a book by the author Robert Greene on applying strategic thinking to everyday life. \"It's a bit of a mystery to me,\" Mr. Greene said, when told that his book had been flagged.There is also, puzzlingly, an audio file of a metal song: \"Cause and Effect,\" by the Japanese band Unholy Grave. The reason for the song's inclusion was not clear, and an email sent to an address on Unholy Grave's website was not answered.After Fengcai scans a phone, the app generates a report containing all contacts, text messages and call records, as well as lists of calendar entries and of other apps installed on the device. It sends this information to a server. Two of the people who recently crossed the Xinjiang border said that before officials returned phones to their owners, they took photos of each owner's passport next to his or her device, making sure that the app was visible on the screen.This suggests that the authorities have been told to be thorough in scanning visitors' phones, although it was not clear how they were using the information they acquired as a result. It also could not be determined whether anyone had been detained or monitored because of information generated by the app. If Fengcai remains on a person's phone after it is installed, it does not continue scanning the device in the background, the app's code indicates. Officials in Xinjiang are now gathering oceans of personal information, including DNA and data about people's movements. It would not be surprising for the Chinese authorities to want this harvesting of data to begin at the region's borders.China's Ministry of Public Security and the Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxed requests for comment.Names that appear in Fengcai's source code suggest that the app was made by a unit of FiberHome, a producer of optical cable and telecom equipment that is partly owned by the Chinese state. The unit, Nanjing FiberHome StarrySky Communication Development Company, says on its website that it offers products to help the police collect and analyze data, and that it has signed agreements with security authorities across China. FiberHome and StarrySky did not respond to requests for comment. According to StarrySky's website, the company offers \"cellphone forensic equipment,\" which it says can extract, analyze and recover data from mobile phones. On another page, StarrySky says the purpose of its \"smart policing\" products is \"to let there be not a bad guy in the world who is hard to catch.\"Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Berlin."}, "GM_1854": {"true_label": "10", "text": "TECHNOLOGY;Beyond the gym: Wearable tech's next frontier;Devices that measure personal data are gaining traction and startups are hopeful of a hot trend - but privacy issues loom Chris Dancy started measuring his life four years ago.It started with social media, then grew to health monitors, and home devices.

But he is a trailblazer for a broader personal data revolution, or \"quantified self\" movement, that's gaining traction among technology enthusiasts, fitness gurus and data-lovers alike.The market for gadgets that monitor our lives is undeniably on the rise. Research confirms that wearable technology is expected to be among the hottest emerging trends. But beyond the hype, there is nagging uncertainty: No one has gotten wearable technology quite right so far, take up is slow, and there are lingering concerns about privacy. And what are people supposed to do with all of this data anyway?That hasn't stopped businesses, from tech giants to startups, from jumping in to the fledgling market. Google is expected to begin distributing its Glass to a wider group later this year, and released a version of its Android operating system for smart watches on Thursday. Samsung released the Galaxy Gear smart watch last September. Rumours are flying about an Apple iWatch.Startups such as Pebble have established resounding success: Its smart watch became the poster child for crowd-funding campaigns. Meanwhile, Fitbit and Jawbone trackers continue to gain more mainstream appeal.Sales are on the rise - wearable smart device sales jumped 168 per cent to 8.3 million units in 2012, according to Berg Insight. Can wearable-tech graduate from an underground niche - only popular among the most sophisticated gadget hounds - to a mass-produced, ubiquitous companion such as the iPhone? Or is the dizzying hype surrounding these devices just smoke and mirrors?Duncan Stewart, director of technology and telecom research at Deloitte, says the wearable-tech industry is interesting and important, but the number of unit sales is \"almost certainly smaller than the hype would indicate.\"Mr. Stewart attributes lacklustre sales to the \"gym effect.\" People will buy a wristband to track their activity with the best intentions, but then eventually get lazy. He predicts there might be four million units of wristbands sold in 2014, which is still significant, but \"it's not 40 million, or 400 million.\"Still, companies dipping their feet into wearable tech are optimistic that the excitement surrounding these products will translate into hard sales.Karl Martin, CEO of Toronto startup Bionym, is launching a wristband that will unlock passwords based on your heartbeat. The Nymi wristband, set to officially launch next year, will connect your identity to smart devices so that when you are wearing it, you can unlock doors, computer passwords, or anything that requires authentication. The band uses a biometric sensor to identify you based on your electrocardiogram.Mr. Martin says that the next stage is developing intelligence to turn the raw data into actionable insight. \"Something predictive. That says actually you should sleep earlier, or later, because that matches your physiology better.\"One area with seemingly unlimited potential is health care. Push Fitness, another Toronto-based startup, developed a weight-training tracker for professional athletes. But CEO Rami Alhamed quickly saw the potential for a bigger customer base. Push received 134,000 preorders for its wristband, and 75 per cent were regular consumers, not professional teams.The Push tracker has caused a stir in the professional sports arena, but regular gym-goers and CrossFit enthusiasts are also showing huge interest in it as a tool to measure performance during a workout and optimize exercise routines. The implications reach beyond gym rats, though. Insurance and health-care providers are already looking into how to capture this personal data into adaptive health care strategies and disease prevention.Privacy is a huge roadblock to mass adoption of wearable devices. Google recently told Gmail users they have \"no presumption of privacy\" over e-mails. Presumably, this extends to Glass, through which Google would have access to our street views.Consumers are all too aware of this. One-third of Internet users worldwide are worried that wearable devices will invade people's privacy, according to a September, 2013, poll by Survey Sampling International. And two-third of users feel that wearable devices should be regulated in some way, according to a University of London study.\"People need to feel they are in control of their own data,\" Mr. Martin says. \"We know we have to get [privacy] right, or we could blow the whole thing.\"**************WITHIN ARM'S REACHGoogle leaps into wearable technologyGoogle's new Android software development kit, tailored to suit wearable technology, is bolstering strong rumours it is poised to launch its own smartwatch, code-named Google Gem, later this year.SMARTWATCH CONCEPTNavigation: Google has patented Touchpads on strap.

Even some of the law's biggest supporters are frustrated with how it has worked.In addition, the response to Covid-19 is raising new questions about the role of privacy safeguards, as digital tools for tracking health and location information, once viewed warily by the European authorities, are now crucial parts of containment strategies.The law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., created new limits on how companies can collect and share data without user consent. It gave governments broad authority to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue, or to force changes to its data-collection practices. The policy served as a model for new privacy rules in Brazil, Japan, India and elsewhere.But since the law was enacted, in May 2018, Google has been the only giant tech company to be penalized - a fine of 50 million euros, worth roughly $54 million today, or about one-tenth of what Google generates in sales each day. No major fines or penalties have been announced against Facebook, Amazon or Twitter.The inaction is creating tension within European governments, as some leaders call for speedier enforcement and broader changes. Privacy groups and smaller tech companies complain that companies like Facebook and Google are avoiding tough oversight. At the same time, the public's experience with the G.D.P.R. has been a frustrating number of pop-up consent windows to click through when visiting a website.Europe's challenges risk undermining efforts elsewhere in the world to create tougher privacy rules, said Johnny Ryan, a leading campaigner for privacy regulation. He said American officials had told him that Europe's problems with putting G.D.P.R. into effect were a reason not to create federal standards in the United States.\"If you don't have strong, robust enforcement and investment, this law is a fantasy,\" said Mr. Ryan, the chief policy officer at Brave, which makes an internet browser with privacy protections to limit data tracking and advertising. \"We have failed to realize the potential of G.D.P.R. thus far.\"Supporters acknowledge that the law has had growing pains and that cases have taken longer as new procedures are put in place. But they say it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions. The law has increased awareness about privacy and forced many companies, including Facebook and Google, to adopt new policies to comply. California and New York have adopted similar privacy laws.The biggest test of the G.D.P.R. thus far will come in the months ahead, supporters argue, when a batch of rulings involving big technology companies are expected. Twitter is expected to be one of the first to be penalized, in an Irish case related to data breaches. WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service, faces possible penalties for sharing data with other Facebook services.\"The G.D.P.R. is a long-term project,\" said Eduardo Ustaran, who leads the privacy practice at Hogan Lovells International, a London law firm that represents many large companies. \"The past couple of years barely give us a glimpse of whether this project will be successful.\"Facebook said in a statement that it was committed to the principles of the G.D.P.R., which have resulted in making \"our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\"Amazon said that as a result of the law, it had introduced a new privacy help page where customers can see more information about data the company collects. Google and Twitter declined to comment.Many critics said that even if the companies were penalized, the actions had taken too long, leaving regulators at risk of fighting yesterday's battles. The cases could drag for several more years as a result of court appeals. And with limited financial resources, critics argue, the authorities are inclined to be overly cautious and avoid more complex cases.Adding to the challenges is the coronavirus pandemic, which has altered the debate about how to build mobile apps and other technologies. Techniques that were once seen as intrusive in Europe, like collecting location and health data, are part of government plans to contain the virus.The G.D.P.R. provides \"legal grounds to enable the employers and the competent public health authorities to process personal data in the context of epidemics, without the need to obtain the consent\" of individuals, the European Data Protection Board, which helps coordinate enforcement of the law, said in a recent statement. The European Commission delayed until June the release of a full review of the G.D.P.R. as a result of the virus.Frustrated by the lack of progress, Mr. Ryan spent several weeks examining budget and staffing data from 28 European countries. Mr. Ryan, who lives in Ireland and filed a complaint with regulators there against Google over its ad-targeting practices, found that all but three - Germany, Britain and Italy - had data protection agencies with annual budgets of less than (EURO)25 million.In his report, to be published this week, Mr. Ryan found that most countries had only a handful of investigators with industrial expertise dedicated to reviewing technology industry cases. He is filing a complaint with the European Union asking it to penalize countries that do not give data protection agencies enough resources.Regulators acknowledge the problem and have called for more money. In a February survey of privacy regulators in 30 European countries, 21 responded that \"resources are not enough\" to fulfill their responsibilities. Luxembourg, which is responsible for regulating Amazon, had a budget of roughly (EURO)5.7 million last year, worth about $6.2 million, or roughly Amazon's sales over 10 minutes.\"We have a lack of enforcement,\" said Ulrich Kelber, the chairman of Germany's data protection authority, which has the highest budget in the European Union, at roughly (EURO)85 million when including regional agencies. \"Most of the European governments don't give enough resources to the data protection authorities.\"He called for a more centralized approach, in which countries pool resources and share responsibilities for investigating the biggest companies. Currently, each country is responsible for regulating companies that have their European headquarters within its borders.At the center of the dispute is Ireland, which has outsize influence over the law's enforcement because Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter are all based there. The country is responsible for leading more investigations, 127, than any other country in Europe, according to Brave. Yet in nearly two years, it has not issued a single G.D.P.R. penalty.Ireland's budget of (EURO)16.9 million ranks sixth among data protection agencies in Europe. Last year, Ireland's data protection regulator sought a budget increase of (EURO)5.9 million. It got a third of that amount.Helen Dixon, the chair of Ireland's data protection agency, said she was frustrated by the budget restrictions but defended the work of her office. More than 140 people work in her office, compared with 27 in 2017. She graded Ireland's performance an \"A for effort\" but a \"C-plus/B-minus in terms of output.\"Ms. Dixon said rulings involving Twitter, Facebook and others were coming. But she said her office had been overwhelmed by complaints filed by advocates like Mr. Ryan that called for sweeping, resource-intensive investigations of entire industries like digital advertising. Under the law, regulators must respond to every complaint filed - more than 12,000 in Ireland since 2018.Companies like Facebook asked a slew of procedural legal questions that must be responded to before cases can advance, Ms. Dixon said. Google stalled regulators by not immediately declaring where its European headquarters would be.Ms. Dixon said many people wrongly assumed that the G.D.P.R. would result in a swift and wholesale shake-up of data-collection practices of the largest tech companies.\"There will be fines, there is no doubt about that,\" she said, but the law \"doesn't allow for taking on an entire sector.\"Regulators have other leverage beyond investigations, Ms. Dixon said. Facebook delayed the release of its dating app, she explained, after the Irish authorities raised questions about its data collection.\"There are lots of different ways to go about creating a positive effect,\" she said. \"Not all of them cater around fines and the superficial commentary we sometimes see.\""}, "DT_669": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Better to target press, say judges;Internet threat The internet is \"out of control\" in breaking injunctions, but it is still more important that court orders target the established media, senior judges said yesterday.Lord Neuberger, the Master of the Rolls, admitted that bloggers and users of websites such as Twitter would not necessarily be covered by court orders, even though some \"peddle lies\".But he rejected claims that the situation made injunctions futile because the internet had \"by no means the same degree of intrusion into privacy as the story being emblazoned on the front pages of newspapers\", which \"people trust more\".The effectiveness of injunctions has been questioned after the alleged identities of many of those who have obtained one were published on Twitter.However, Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, said that society should consider other ways to control Twitter and other sites, rather than leaving at their mercy those who had a genuine need for privacy.\"Anybody can put anything on it,\" he said. \"Modern technology is totally out of control.\" But he added: \"I'm not giving up on the possibility that people who peddle lies about others through using technology may one day be brought under control, maybe through damages, very substantial damages, maybe even injunctions.\"Tom Whitehead"}, "TDP_1667": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Hospitals' photo ban a delusion Hospitals must know that they can't simply ban photographs within their walls. A ban would be bureaucratic, high- handed, and unenforceable all at once.\"People used to just take a photograph and stick it in their family album. Now it can go anywhere,\" says Nelson Marlborough District Health Board chief medical officer Nick Baker. To which the right reply is: so what?It's a banal truth of modern life that images can end up anywhere. It doesn't follow that the taking of such photos must automatically be stopped, no matter what a health bureaucrat might think.There are a small number of occasions on which taking a photograph in a hospital might lead to serious harm or trouble. But Privacy Commissioner John Edward is right when he says the DHBs need to make sure they're not using a sledgehammer to open a nut.Photographing a doctor doing a consultation, for instance, is not the unconscionable act that health professionals might suppose. There might be very good reasons to film it, none of them life-threatening to staff. Patients often have trouble remembering the details of a consultation, and the details might be seriously important to their health. If it's recorded, it can be revisited.It's not obvious, either, why doctors should expect to remain anonymous and private when they work in big public buildings such as hospitals. Where is the harm in them appearing in someone's home movie?It is claimed that gangs take films in order to intimidate staff, though just how this occurs remains obscure. If gangs did this, they should be dealt with according to the law. That is the way to stop the abuse, not by an unenforceable ban on photography.Some officials apparently argue that films of consultations could be used maliciously if a relationship between a patient or family and the clinician broke down. It's hard to see how - unless the doctor was doing something he or she should not have been doing.A video of a normal consultation is simply a conversation about a health issue in which the health expert gives his or her opinion and recommendations. Only if the health professional is noticeably obnoxious or incompetent could it be a source of difficulty.Edwards says that DHBs have an obligation to protect staff from harm but doctors and nurses otherwise don't have any special legal right not to be recorded while working. And this is the point. Health professionals are accountable for the work they do. They don't avoid accountability simply by banning filming.Photographs, in fact, should increase accountability and are, therefore, generally a good thing.DHBs make fools of themselves when they issue unenforceable edicts. Do they really suppose that they will stop families taking snaps of wives and daughters with newborn babies?The whole controversy is another case of authoritarian cultures failing to adapt to modern mores and technology.

The group of regulators, coordinating their response via the EU, pledged to take \"repressive action\" to break the impasse.Google introduced the new policy despite calls to delay it for regulatory scrutiny, and said yesterday that it believed the data-merging was in line with European privacy laws.  \"Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services,\" a spokesman said. \"We have engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process, and we'll continue to do so.\"  Regulators say Google's policy does not provide its hundreds of millions of visitors with full information about how they would be tracked or how that data would be used. Those who did not agree to the creation of a master profile were told they would have to stop using Google services.  CNIL will meet its counterparts to discuss their next move on February 26. Each domestic regulator is responsible for applying its own penalties for breaches of data protection law. The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, can impose fines of up to \u00a3500,000 and recently handed Sony a \u00a3250,000 penalty for a security failure that allowed hackers to access PlayStation gamers' personal details.

Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations.The report will go first to the White House, then to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where lawmakers will read it in a secure location, Republican senators said.Senate Republicans plan the cautious approach amid a debate over how much of the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's past should be available for public view. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said only that senators will be able to see the results of the FBI's work. A handful of Senate aides may view the findings as well.The report was the result of a dramatic and emotional hearing before the Judiciary Committee last week in which Ford and Kavanaugh recalled the summer of 1982, when she said the attack occurred. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but called for the reopening of the investigation into his background.Republican leaders and White House officials said the strict limitations on who would see the results are standard practice for background checks on nominees for senior roles.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a Judiciary Committee member, said it would be ideal to make public as much information as possible, allowing for redactions of private or compromising information. \"But I think if the report disappears into a black hole from which no fact emerges, it will just add to the dissension here and to the questions,\" he said.Republicans noted that a bipartisan memorandum of understanding in 2009 dictates the handling of such reports. George Hartmann, a Judiciary Committee spokesman, told USA TODAY that the guidelines call for sending a single copy of the FBI's findings to Capitol Hill and housing it in a safe in the committee's office.Democrats questioned the secrecy - and the decision to rely on the standard procedure - given the significance.Ron Klain, a veteran Washington attorney and former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, said there is nothing wrong with maintaining the confidentiality of the report as long as it doesn't make it impossible for senators to digest the information before the vote.\"Standard procedures often need to be modified for nonstandard situations,\" Klain said. He cited the example of how the FBI's findings were handled when it investigated accusations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Klain was a chief counsel for Judiciary Committee Democrats during the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991.\"In extraordinary situations - like the Thomas-Hill hearings - procedures have been adopted to protect confidentiality while also facilitating access for all senators,\" he said.Some Republican senators said at least a portion of the document should be available for public review.\"I hope the FBI report is made public. Normally, it is not, out of respect for the privacy for the person being investigated, but this is an unusual circumstance,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R.-La., on the Judiciary Committee.Kennedy said that if all findings cannot  be released, he'd support  an objective summary of the report to be shared to avoid senators leaking \"selected versions that advance their position.\"The Justice Department referred questions about the investigation to the White House. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \"We've been very open and transparent throughout the process.\"It is not clear whether the document will draw conclusions about the allegations.Michael Mukasey, a former U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush, said the supplemental FBI background investigation would cover credible allegations of misconduct. The FBI probably won't try to resolve disputes between conflicting witnesses, and witnesses wouldn't be tested by polygraph, he said.Mukasey spoke with reporters on a call organized by Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that backs Kavanaugh's confirmation.\"The FBI doesn't make credibility determinations about ultimate facts,\" Mukasey said.\"They simply present the statements of witnesses so that the senators who are the ultimate deciders can make their decision.\"Contributing: John Fritze, Bart Jansen, Nicole Gaudiano "}, "AFR_910": {"true_label": "01", "text": "IT Robin Hoods want to take back big data Privacy push Scientists working on project that would disrupt the surveillance model used by the likes of Facebook.Australian scientists are taking the first steps towards allowing people to control their own data and possibly charge businesses to gain access to it.The world-leading research project is headed by quantum physicist Stephen Hardy. It involves eight scientists across most of the major research divisions of NICTA, Australia's information communications technology research institute.Using federal government funding that will run out in 2018 because of budget cuts announced last week, the NICTA project team are conducting fundamental research to establish the mechanisms whereby people can keep their information confidential, but still obtain the benefits of the internet economy.The project, codenamed MAGIC or Mobile Analytics with Guaranteed Information Control, involves experts in software systems for the cloud, machine learning for the analytics, networking for privacy-preserving computation and engineering.The project was born during a brainstorming session last year at the NICTA head office in Redfern in Sydney.\"MAGIC is blue-sky research,\" Dr Hardy said. \"It started with a bright idea, hatched last year by banging ideas from cryptography from NICTA's Networks researchers against new cloud computing approaches from NICTA's Software Systems researchers, and against data analysis algorithms from NICTA's Machine Learning research group.\"We realised that we could take our analysis to the data, and work in a way where we don't learn anything about individuals, only about their aggregated data.\"If the project is successful it will be possible to protect the privacy of individuals' data while at the same time delivering detailed data insights to organisations.Dr Hardy admits that it could take years before individuals regained control of all the data they had shared with big business but he said pressure was rising for organisations to hand over information.\"The idea that a person should have control of their own data is gaining momentum in parts of the ICT community,\" he said. \"However, the technical tools to enable this are not yet established.\"The sorts of tools we will need to make this happen will initially be opt-in programming interfaces used by cloud service providers that allow personal information to be collected in an individual's personal cloud.\"As and if these disruptive technologies develop, companies such as Google and Facebook that rely on the provision of personal information to drive their advertising business models will have to adapt to the increasing pressure to allow people to control their own data.\"Breaking the surveillance business modelPaul Davis, a director of specialist technology funds manager Loftus Peak, said there will inevitably be a process whereby people regain control of the information about themselves and then decide who will get a share of that.\"The security technologist Bruce Schnier says that the business model of the internet is surveillance,\" Mr Davis said. \"In effect people are making money out of watching you - watching what you buy, where you go what you say, who your friends are.\"He said the shift in the control of data from big business to individuals could be very disruptive to companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook.Dr Hardy said that in the shorter term, the NICTA research would focus on commercial opportunities that focus on confidential information owned by businesses.He said a business that wanted to combine their data with data from other businesses to learn more about their market, could use the NICTA analytics without compromising commercially sensitive information. \"Our approach allows the analytics to move to the data - our algorithms are run in each data centre, and only carefully encrypted and aggregated data is passed out of the country - with no loss of individually identifiable information,\" he said.One possible use for the analytics would be in relation to genomic data, which is stored in large data warehouses in central repositoriesin different countries. Dr Hardy said that the logical extension would be when each individual controlled access to their genome. Their data could be kept private, but public good and other analytic outcomes could be performed on their data."}, "USA_1813": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Snapchat: Parents, this is what it is and how to use it In case you haven't heard, Snapchat is kind of a big deal.The messaging app is particularly popular among teenagers. A recent survey done by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found nearly three-quarters of all teens use Snapchat and fellow messaging app Instagram. That's more than the two-thirds of teens who say they use Facebook.So what is it, exactly? Snapchat is a messaging app in which users can send Snaps, consisting mostly of photos or video, that disappear after they're viewed by the recipient. The other fun feature: filters. They can turn your selfie into the image of an adorable puppy, or a video of a deer sounding like it inhaled helium. Other filters include frames showing location or highlighting a special event.As a parent, this is my primary way of using the app. Seriously, how can you not resist turning your kids into sloths? It's great if you need to occupy your kids for a couple minutes.The filters are so popular pretty much every other social app including Twitter and Instagram have introduced their own filters.Because it's social and the Snaps users send disappear, there are  concerns about what your kids might see, as well as who can view their Snaps. Fortunately, multiple default Snapchat settings make the process easier if you're a parent, but you still want to pay close attention to protect your children.So, what is Snapchat, and why do your kids like it so much?Let's break it down:What is Snapchat?It's a messaging app emphasizing the use of photos and videos to express yourself. In a 2015 video explaining Snapchat, founder and CEO Evan Spiegel says this generation views photos and videos as more than just a way of saving memories. \"When you see your children taking a zillion photographs of things you would never take a picture of, it's because they're using photographs to talk,\" he said.When you open the app, you're directed straight to the camera. You can either take a picture by tapping the giant circle near the bottom of the screen, or hold it down for video. You can also hold down anywhere on the screen to bring up a set of augmented reality filters to add elements such as bunny ears to a picture. Most of the filters are fun, although they have gotten Snapchat into trouble.Once you capture a picture or video, you can access another set of filters by swiping left or right. These bring up the filters similar to ones you see on Instagram, or add other details such as your location. Along with filters, you can add emojis, text or other stickers to spruce up your Snap.When ready, you can  send it directly to a friend or share it as part of \"My Story,\" a feature in which users can recap their days by adding a variety of photos and videos. You can swipe left to go to Chat or swipe right to reach Discover, a section where publishers have added their own stories you can track. Swiping down takes you to Memories, where you can save Snaps to the app or your smartphone's camera roll.How popular is Snapchat?More than 2 billion Snaps a day go out. According to their initial public offering filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission this year, Snapchat boasts 158million daily active users who create 2.5 billion Snaps a day. Parent company Snap says 60% of its daily active users create Snaps on a daily basis. Over the past year, Snapchat has consistently hovered at or near the top five apps overall, analytics firm App Annie says.Why is it so popular?Initially, part of Snapchat's coolness factor lied in how confusing it was to use. Early versions of Snapchat offered zero instruction on how to use it, which made it appealing to teens who could easily figure it out. If you had to point to a breakout moment, it was in 2015 when DJ Khaled,  already a heavy user of the app at the time, recounted a scary jet ski ride leaving him lost at sea for several hours.Then there's the disappearing messages, which Snapchat says was built to mimic conversations in the real world. \"When you go to lunch with a friend, the conversation doesn't last beyond the meal -- and Snapchat has managed to recreate that light, low-pressure feeling,\" reads a parents guide published by Snapchat.It also notes the app removes any concerns over managing your presence or suffering from \"reputation anxiety\" as with other apps.Should I worry about my kids using it?Because Snaps disappear on the app, users might get the urge to post stuff  a little more risqu\u00e9, thinking it will be scrubbed from their Story or Chat message.However, users can take a screenshot of their smartphone to preserve an image, and third-party apps exist to allow users to save others' Snaps.Snapchat does allow users to replay Snaps, so long as the user keeps the Snap open. As soon as they dismiss it, it's gone. Also, if someone has taken a screenshot of a Snap, the app will alert users.There's also the My Eyes Only feature, where users can lock down images or videos with a passcode in their Memories. So if your teenage kids have their own accounts, it's a popular place to hide photos or videos out of parents' view. By default, most privacy settings in Snapchat are set to Friends, which means the user must approve who can view their Story or contact them in Chat. Users can head to settings and opt to include Everyone if they want a more public profile.How can I protect them?Snapchat requires users be at least 13 years old to have an account. If you have a younger child who really wants to see themselves captured in a puppy filter, consider opening a shared account. Then you can see what they're sharing.If you let your kids have their own account, remind them that although Snapchat will delete Snaps or Stories after a set time, it doesn't mean they are gone forever. As Snapchat points out in its parents guide: \"It's important to remind kids to never send Snaps that are illegal, could get them in trouble now or in the future, or would be embarrassing if seen by people like grandparents or college admissions officers.\"Double check privacy settings to make sure it's for Friends only, instead of Everyone. Also, users can easily share their Snapchat handle either by name or Snapcode, an icon users can scan with their camera to add as a friend.

The service automatically created public circles of friends for users based on their most frequent Gmail contacts.But many users complained that they didn't want all their email contacts - which could include ex-spouses, doctors, employers and recruiters - to become part of a social network for anyone to see.The settlement announced yesterday with the Federal Trade Commission requires Google to study both its existing services and any new services it launches to determine if they pose risks to user privacy - and develop policies to address those risks if they do.The settlement mandates independent audits to oversee and verify Google's privacy program every other year for the next 20 years.The settlement also requires Google to obtain user consent before sharing consumer information with third parties if it alters a service to use the data in a way that would violate its existing privacy policy.The FTC charged that Google had violated its own privacy policy by taking personal information provided for Gmail and integrating it into Buzz without permission, even though it had promised to obtain consent before using information \"in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected.\"\"When companies make privacy pledges, they need to honor them,\" FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in a statement.The FTC complaint outlined a number of problems with Buzz. Those included ineffective options to let users decline to participate in the service, confusing and hard-to-find controls to let users limit sharing of their email contacts, and inadequate notice of exactly what the service did.After receiving thousands of complaints, Google responded by tweaking the service to make it easier for users to hide their lists of contacts and block specific people from following their Buzz updates, including links, posts, photos and videos.In addition, the company agreed late last year to give about $8.5 million to internet privacy and policy organizations to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by Gmail users over Buzz.Jessica Rich, deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the agency hopes that Wednesday's settlement will help set privacy standards for companies across the internet ecosystem - not just Google.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy watchdog group that filed the FTC complaint about Google Buzz that led to Wednesday's settlement, echoed that point. \"For internet users, the FTC decision should lead to higher privacy standards and better protection for personal data,\" EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said in a statement.For its part, Google said in a blog post that it hopes the FTC settlement puts the issue behind it and apologized for its missteps with Buzz.\"We try to be clear about what data we collect and how we use it - and to give people real control over the information they share with us,\" the blog post said. \"That said, we don't always get everything right. The launch of Google Buzz fell short of our usual standards for transparency and user control - letting our users and Google down.\"Google has already stepped up its efforts to improve its privacy policies and practices following last year's disclosure that it had inadvertently sucked up fragments of emails, Web surfing behavior and other online activities over public Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries while photographing neighborhoods for its \"Street View\" mapping feature.Google said it discovered the problem after an inquiry by German regulators.The FTC's rebuke is the latest blow that the government has dealt to Google. Last week, a federal judge rejected a proposed legal settlement that would have given Google the digital rights to millions of out-of-print books after determining that the agreement would have violated US copyright laws and given Google's already-dominant search engine an unfair advantage over its rivals.Google is hoping to avoid another setback as it tries to persuade the Justice Department to approve its proposed $700 million acquisition of online air fare tracker ITA Software.The Justice Department has spent the past eight months examining whether the deal would allow Google to use its search engine to highlight its travel recommendations over other services and withhold the latest technology from rivals who already license ITA Software's products.Lawyers familiar with antitrust reviews expect the Justice Department to decide whether to challenge the acquisition or approve it, possibly with strings attached, within the next month.-AP"}, "TS_4374": {"true_label": "10", "text": "City worker guilty in voyeurism case;Former public health supervisor filmed co-workers, other women A former supervisor with Toronto Public Health will be sentenced next month after pleading guilty in the Ontario Court of Justice to two counts of voyeurism.Robert Coughlin, 69, admitted in court on May 19 that he, for a sexual purpose, surreptitiously made visual recordings of unidentified women and female staff at a Toronto Public Health's office downtown Toronto between January 2008 and July 2015, according to court documents. The performance management supervisor set up cameras under the desk in his office, hid more cameras in his backpack and used his cellphone to record women after calling them into his office, according to one of the victims, who spoke to the Star on Friday.The woman said after police investigated, staff were asked to go into Coughlin's office to clean out his files, where they discovered more cameras police hadn't removed.Coughlin was charged with 24 counts of voyeurism involving 13 named female victims, whose identities are protected by a court-ordered publication ban. The charges also related to the \"recording of unidentified females.\"Coughlin was fired last year.

We said at the time of launching it that we wanted to gather a wide range of views, so we welcome the debate and this opportunity to comment. It's worth restating why we took this initiative and clarifying some points. The launch of the website www.youronlinechoices.com.au means for the first time Australian consumers now have a simple mechanism by which they can opt out of online behavioural advertising. Importantly, over time, consumers will be able to opt out of ads from every major industry participant by visiting this website. This puts the user back in control. Calls that behavioural advertising be \"switched off\" by default seem to ignore the potential disruption that it could cause to a consumer's browsing experience - presenting them with multiple pop-up windows when they want to visit a website, preventing them from using the popular \"self-filling\" forms which consumers often use when subscribing to a site or purchasing something online, and affecting browser settings and their broadband speed. It also overlooks the fact that in Australia, unlike some countries, the Privacy Act provides an essential first layer of protection for the privacy and personal information of Australian consumers. The ADAA industry self-regulatory framework provides an additional layer of protection for consumers - and historically, multiple layers of protection operate very well together to provide robust surety for consumers. Instead ADAA has focused on educating consumers about how behavioural advertising works and given them the choice to decide what they want. We think choice is essential, especially when you consider international experience has shown that between just 0.2 and 1.1 per cent of consumers opt to switch off such targeted advertising when they have a choice. ADAA is working on a comprehensive compliance process that will be open, transparent and independently overseen. We are setting about on engaging privacy governance professionals to advise us on the best way to go about this, and we're confident that this will be in place in the next six months. At launch we had 10 signatory companies, and support from all the main ad industry groups, all of whom have six months to comply with the guideline - and we have been delighted by the number of additional companies who since the launch have indicated they want to sign up. We see this as an important measure of industry's commitment to the initiative. As more companies come on board, consumers will have even greater transparency and choice about how they engage with such advertising, and this will minimise the potential for bad practice across the Australian media landscape. We expect the overwhelming majority of companies will embrace this guideline and initiative as a positive, proactive step that they need to be a part of, and this will have a positive flow-on effect through the industry as a whole. Remember, the launch of the guideline is just the first, proactive and essential step on a continuous path. We are developing a comprehensive framework for Australian consumers that both protects their privacy and supports the continued growth of the Australian media industry, which provides a multibillion-dollar contribution to a vital digital economy, providing jobs, investment, business opportunities and new technology development."}, "NYT_3742": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Taming the Apex Predators of Tech FULL TEXTIn a tech galaxy that now seems far, far away, everyone was terrified of Bill Gates. He was the Apex Predator of Tech.You wanted to make software? Microsoft would crush you. You wanted to start an online service? Microsoft would decimate you. You wanted to make a browser to navigate the World Wide Web? Chomp!It was that last one that finally stopped Mr. Gates and Microsoft. The government accused the company of being a monopoly and of engaging in anticompetitive practices against Netscape and its Navigator browser. In 2001 the government won a landmark case against the company that required it to submit to more oversight and make it easier for other companies to offer competing software.The Sherman Antitrust Act had prevailed over the leading power in tech, and what happened after was a resurgence of innovation that ushered in a spate of new companies and ideas. You can draw a pretty straight line from that decision to the growth of Google and Amazon and Apple, the explosion of Facebook and the introduction of start-ups like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Slack.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Yay, capitalism and unfettered markets! Boo, a concentration of control!In recent years tech has backtracked, except this time we have several Apex Predators instead of just one. Google and Facebook are the most obvious. More and more people in the media and in politics, as well as consumers, have become fearful of these companies for the damage they can do and the unregulated power they wield.Something has to be done, but what? Even as distrust of big tech companies increases and governments move to control them, their businesses have never been more successful.One option is privacy legislation. Europe passed such a law in 2016. While there is no national privacy law in the United States, California will soon have a state-level law, and other states are considering similar reforms. The idea of restricting tech companies' use of personal data becomes more popular with every hack and every instance of abuse. Still, the likelihood of the United States passing a national privacy law with teeth is small.Then there are the fines, such as a multibillion-dollar one that the Federal Trade Commission is considering to punish Facebook for privacy violations. While the fine would be the largest the agency has ever levied, it would also be far too small to make a difference. When Facebook announced it might have to hand over $5 billion as its get-out-of-jail-free card, Wall Street cheered and Facebook stock rose.Meanwhile, there's a lot of talk about the ways that countries can work together to improve the online ecosystem. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand met with President Emmanuel Macron of France last week, for example, about creating an intergovernmental effort to end online extremism. While laudable in theory, very little of this hand-wringing is likely to result in any rules with heft. In addition, the prospect of governments making rules around the restriction of speech is rife with ethical dilemmas.Finally there's the biggest gun: Using antitrust law to break up big tech companies. Calls for antitrust action have become increasingly loud, most notably in a recent essay in this paper by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. His statement that the company should be broken up attracted a lot of attention, especially after he called the power held by Mark Zuckerberg, his former college roommate, \"un-American.\" That had to hurt, even if the blow is likely to be glancing, since antitrust cases are slow-moving and hard to pull off.And yet the idea of using antitrust to rein in these companies got a significant boost recently with the Supreme Court's decision to allow a lawsuit from consumers aimed at how Apple runs its App Store to proceed in a lower court.Breaking with the more conservative wing of the court in a 5-4 decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion that Apple's arguments that it wasn't subject to a lawsuit over its app prices \"disregard statutory text and precedent, create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers and furnish monopolistic retailers with a how-to guide for evasion of the antitrust laws.\"Apple has and will continue to argue that it is not a monopoly in either hardware and software - which is true. But the case, though narrow, is still a flashing neon sign of change. It centers on rethinking the idea of what a monopoly is with an eye to the power of the network effect. Even if a company doesn't completely dominate its sector, if its platform can exercise what amounts to an iron-fisted control over consumers, perhaps it should be considered a monopoly after all.[Technology has made our lives easier.

Google's share of the search market allows it to dominate mapping, recommendations, email, video, documents and more, while Facebook rules the social media world through its main app along with Instagram and WhatsApp. None of this is good for consumers, except perhaps by the measure of convenience, because the choices they have are limited and never likely to challenge the status quo. In other words, these companies are Apex Predators, too. You don't have to be as powerful as Bill Gates once was to be just as harmful.

The Director of the US Cyber Consequences Unit, Scott Borg, described it as \"remarkable\" and \"illuminating\".But for Glenn Greenwald, a key collaborator and staunch defender of fugitive former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden - who General Alexander says was responsible for the most damaging intelligence leaks in history - the Financial Review's \"remarkably long and wide-ranging interview\" (that yielded \"vital\" admissions) was \"uncritical\" and \"sycophantic\".This is a taste of the bewildering polarities in the furore over liberty and security that has erupted since Snowden took it upon himself to steal more than 100,000 NSA documents on its classified intelligence collection capabilities without, General Alexander says, availing himself of ordinary whistleblowing avenues, like the NSA's general counsel, the Inspector General, or Congress.Offered safe harbour by Russia after China's regime allowed him to avoid US extradition from Hong Kong, and happily fielding \"Dorothy Dixers\" to Russia's president Vladimir Putin on national television, Snowden is, in General Alexander's judgment, now an instrument of foreign intelligence agencies.Disclosures 'will make us stronger'And yet, notwithstanding Snowden's clearly illegal and, from an intelligence perspective, immensely destructive decisions, President Obama conceded in a landmark January speech that the debate initiated by the disclosures \"will make us stronger\" and had led him, after a deliberate review process, to \"announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms\" to America's intelligence gathering goliath. Indeed, Snowden was runner-up in Time's 2013 \"Person of the Year\" competition and ranked number one in Foreign Policy's 2013 list of \"Leading Global Thinkers\". The Washington Post and The Guardian were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for \"public service\" this year for their coverage of his leaks.But if you listen to General Alexander or Australia's Attorney General, George Brandis, Snowden is a traitor. In an April speech in Washington, Brandis argued Snowden is neither a \"whistleblower, nor, despite the best efforts of some of the gullible self-loathing left, or the anarcho-libertarian right, to romanticise him, is he any kind of folk hero\".\"He is a traitor because, by a cold-blooded and calculated act, he attacked your country by significantly damaging its capacity to defend itself from its enemies, and in doing so, he put your citzens' lives at risk.\" General Alexander agrees- and accuses a complicit media of the same. One way to make sense of this disconnect is by juxtaposing the divergent claims of leading civil libertarians, who can be distinguished by those who have had a chance to examine what the NSA does, and those who have not.According to the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Centre for Internet and Society, Jennifer Granick, \"the good people at NSA have literally pulverised the Fourth Amendment, government accountability, freedom of expression, rule of law, and so many other equally critical components of the American system\". Put more bluntly, \"it's time to call the NSA's mass surveillance programs what they are: criminal\".Libertarians differGranick is an outsider and, in her defence, made these remarks before the Obama Administration had published the findings of its exhaustive review process in December 2013. Granick's position, which is representative of the views of many anarcho-libertarians such as Wikileak's Julian Assange, can be contrasted against the insider account of one of America's most highly-regarded civil libertarians and constitutional lawyers, Geoffrey Stone.Professor Stone, who is a professor at the University of Chicago and serves on the Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union, was hand-picked by President Barack Obama as one of five members of his personal \"review group\" to appraise the NSA's activities post-Snowden.The other members of this Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies were professors of privacy and constitutional law, a former deputy director of the CIA, and a senior counter-terrorism expert. In an interview with the Financial Review, Professor Stone explains that he was an unashamed NSA sceptic before having an opportunity to assess its practices from the inside.\"I went into the NSA with the preconceptions that the media had shaped, which is that it was running amok and the review group's job was to stop them from doing so,\" he said.\"I had casually bought into the notion that NSA were the bad guys.\"But to his \"surprise\" what the review group found \"was that the NSA has been doing what it has been authorised to do... by statute, judicial decision, and executive order\".Contrary to popular media and pundit myth, the NSA had not been acting like a \"rogue agency and doing things outside the bounds of what it has been instructed to do\". Professor Stone says the NSA's many critics have \"leapt to these conclusions without understanding the background laws\".And it is here we unearth the most important insight: there is, as President Obama says, always scope to reform the way the US intelligence community works in order to shield liberty and privacy.Professor Stone made no bones about the fact that the \"review group certainly took issue with important aspects of the ways these intelligence programs operated and functioned and made 46 strong recommendations to the president on how they could be improved\".Even the cyber-warrior General Alexander buys into the need for regular debate and reform: \"I think it is valuable to have these differences of opinion\". \"Can we do it better?\" he asks. \"The answer is, I think so.\"Concerns addressedHe says in response to the review group's December report, the NSA came up with the solutions to the contentious \"metadata\" gathering program, which gave spies access to domestic communications (specifically, the time, date, duration and numbers of a call but not their content, names or addresses), \"to address the civil liberties and privacy concerns people had while ensuring we did not materially undermine critical capabilities\".The metadata storage system was introduced after 9/11 when seven NSA-intercepted calls made to an al-Qaeda safe house in Yemen by one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar, who was based in California, were assumed to have originated overseas because the NSA did not have the telephone number identifier. While the US program is very similar to \"data retention\" requirements imposed by governments on communications companies around the world, including most European Union states, for security purposes, it has fuelled controversy in America because, as President Obama, correctly notes it had \"never been subject to vigorous public debate\".As a former president of the Harvard Law Review, civil rights attorney and lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Chicago, President Obama is well equipped to opine on the legality of the spies' activities.In January, this characteristically risk-averse lawyer declared that although he always \"maintained a healthy scepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became president\" nothing in his initial post-Snowden review \"and nothing I have learned since indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens \".\"To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job... the men and women of the intelligence community ... consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people,\" President Obama said. \"They're not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails.\"NSA program lawfulIn throwing out an American Civil Liberties Union suit against the government for violating the Fourth Amendment with the metadata program, Judge William Pauley found that it was \"lawful\" and that there was \"no evidence the government has used any of the bulk telephony metadata it collected for any purpose other than investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks\". He emphasised that the program was \"subject to executive and congressional oversight, as well as continual monitoring by a dedicated group of judges who serve on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\"Professor Stone says that in its lazy quest for \"easy victims\" the media has \"demonised\" the NSA. While he believes there has been \"substantial overreach in the formulation of these programs\", he also thinks critics have hit the wrong target. \"It is much more complicated to say members of Congress, the President and executive branch, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have not done their jobs properly.\"According to General Alexander, top politicians, and other intelligence leaders, Snowden's unprecedented theft of vast quantities of classified documents has done enormous damage to the West's ability to identify and prevent threats to its rules-based, market-oriented and democratic business model.For those less concerned with security risks and focused more on the collateral cost to liberty, Snowden has heroically tipped the balance in their favour.

The new Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham has an online portal that allows patients to view and update their own medical records so doctors can get real-time updates.Hunt has also pointed out that patients are dying because they are being prescribed the wrong drug - with errors found in almost one in 12 hospitals' prescriptions. The health secretary claims new technology \"can cut these errors by half\".Hospitals will be expected to bid for cash from a 500m tech fund with detailed plans of how to implement the scheme - and winners will be expected to match the government's contribution.Hunt said: \"The public are rightly sceptical about NHS IT after the failures of the past. But we can't let past failures hold patients back from seeing the benefits of the technology revolution that is transforming services all around us. It is simply maddening to hear stories of elderly dementia patients turning up at A&amp;E with no one able to access their medical history.\"Technology is key to helping our A&amp;E staff meet the massive demand they face as the population increases and ages. This is something on which the government must and will succeed.\"However, experts warned that in the past patients have been deterred from speaking plainly to doctors for fear of other agencies being privy to their medical records. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, told the Guardian that when a similar local scheme was set up in Oxford a local charity pointed out that \"low-income mothers refused to talk to GPs about post-natal depression because they were worried that it would get back to social services. Government is not thinking it through.\"However, there appears to be a steady relaxation of privacy rights in the NHS. In July it was revealed private companies would be able to access confidential medical records for as little as 1.Campaigners also questioned why, despite government assurances, patients who had opted out were being included in the schemes. Terri Dowty, of MedConfidential, said the health secretary had promised 750,000 patients throughout England, who had already opted out of having their data shared under the old summary care record scheme, would be automatically protected from the new NHS plans. However, this decision was overturned by the NHS.Dowty said: \"We have real concerns that the government is not listening. These plans will have a chilling effect on the relationship between doctors and patients. Will women suffering from domestic abuse want to tell their GP if their husbands could beat the password to their patient record out of them? Will the teenager seeking contraception want that information written down?\"In response, a Department of Health spokesman said: \"It is obviously of critical importance that health professionals can maintain accurate records of patient care, so patients get the right treatment. The NHS Constitution makes clear that patients have the right to request that confidential information - in whatever form it is kept - is not used beyond their own care.\"Any electronic patient records system adopted by hospitals must be secure and comply with NHS England's requirement for modern, safe standards of record-keeping.\""}, "SMH_4050": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Changes to census spark confusion, privacy fears;Countdown - Concern over data sharing Chaos continues to plague the countdown to the 2016 census, amid privacy fears, calls for a boycott and phone lines overwhelmed by concerned callers.The census next Tuesday will be the first time the names and addresses of 24 million Australians will be kept and linked to other data for four years, a change that has sparked outrage among public interest groups.\"The whole concept behind privacy is control of your personal information,\" said Kat Lane, vice chair of the Australian Privacy Foundation. \"What we need to understand as a society is that it needs to be a choice whether you share your data with the world and whether you don't.\"Ms Lane said Australians needed to be assured by the government that they would not be prosecuted and fined for not putting their names on the census if they did not wish.\"[The Australian Bureau of Statistics] didn't factor in a large amount of media coverage over what is a significant change . . . the consultation process was so poor, they should be announcing that no one should be prosecuted.\"Australians that do not complete and return a census form could face fines of up to $180 a day.An ABS spokesman said prosecutions and fines were \"a last resort\", and any individual concerns would be worked through on a case-by-case basis.Sixty-five per cent of Australian are expected to complete the census online this year, doubling the online response rate of 2011.Those who do complete the survey online will receive a 12-digit code enabling them to fill out the form online.

Not only has the European Union hit the company with a second antitrust investigation, but - in a move that has received less press, but could have wider consequences - French regulators have pushed it to restrict search results all over the world to comply with their ''right to be forgotten'' privacy laws.That's a problem for a company whose business model is built on search. But it may be an even bigger problem for Internet users. If a European government can control what people all over the world get to see on the Internet, why can't every other country do the same?The back-and-forth between Europe and Google is the latest fallout from a 2014 ruling from Europe's highest court that gave people broad rights to make search engines remove search results about themselves, including links to news articles and other information. People with connections to Europe can file requests with Google to have certain links removed from search results.Google responded by taking search results out of its European versions: Visitors to google.fr or google.de wouldn't see the banned results, but they were still there on google.com. Still, Europeans could navigate to the company's non-European versions. In March French regulators fined the company and said these steps were not enough.Technically, the French may have a point. When Europeans type ''google.com'' into their browsers, Google directs them to their national versions of the service - which, it says, are used by 95 percent of its European users. But Google hadn't erected barriers to stop those people from visiting google.com.In a concession to regulators, Google is changing that now, using ''geo-blocking'' technology to control what European users can see. Under the new system, Google will not only remove links on, say, google.fr, but it will block users in France from seeing those links on any other Google country site, or google.com itself. Unless they use tools like virtual private networks to disguise their locations, users in those countries will see pruned search results.Some say this is a logical solution - avoiding global deletion, while letting a sovereign state enforce its laws, within its borders. But it is a big step away from the Internet's promise of universally accessible information, and a big step toward a world of ''splinternets.''There are several problems with this. Chopping up important parts of the web raises barriers to entry for anyone looking to set up online, from independent bloggers to nongovernmental organizations to businesses. Smaller online services are unlikely to build bespoke French versions, as Google has done. It is easier and cheaper to block French users entirely. That means new entrants miss out on the French market, French Internet users miss out on new content and technologies from abroad, and everyone everywhere misses out on the creativity and innovation that comes from participating in a global Internet.Walling off national Internet sectors also lends legitimacy to countries like China, Turkey and Iran that have long controlled what information their citizens can view online. Just this month, the United States Trade Representative made waves by identifying one such blocking system, China's so-called Great Firewall, as a barrier to trade.News outlets should have particular cause for alarm about geo-blocking. Journalists rely on global networks to investigate and report on international stories, like the recent Panama Papers revelations. They themselves are often the first targets when governments seek to control the flow of information to their citizens. Protection exists in European Union privacy law for journalistic activities, so the news media is not directly in the cross hairs of the ''right to be forgotten.'' But American news organizations have faced libel actions in hostile foreign courts - and when plaintiffs start asking for geo-blocking in those cases, journalists will be on the front lines.Privacy is a real issue, and shouldn't be ignored in the Internet age. But applying those national laws to the Internet needs to be handled with more nuance and concern. These developments should not be driven only by privacy regulators. State departments, trade and justice ministries and telecom regulators in France and other European countries should be demanding a place at the table. So should free-expression advocates.One day, international agreements may sort this all out. But we shouldn't Balkanize the Internet in the meantime.

Since they were revealed last week, the programmes have spurred distrust in the Obama Administration from around the world.Congressional leaders and intelligence committee members have been routinely briefed about the spy programmes, officials said. But the disclosure of their scope stunned some legislators, shocked foreign allies from nations with strict privacy protections and emboldened civil liberties advocates who have long accused the Government of being too invasive in the name of national security.Some congressmen admitted they\"d been caught unawares by the scope of the programmes.\"Congress needs to debate this issue and determine what tools we give to our intelligence community to protect us from a terrorist attack,\" said Representative Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and a backer of the surveillance.\"Really it\"s a debate between public safety, how far we go with public safety and protecting us from terrorist attacks versus how far we go on the other side.\" He said his panel and the House Judiciary Committee will examine what has happened and see whether there are recommendations to be made for the future.The Senate Appropriations defence subcommittee was to question the head of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, today, and the Senate and House intelligence committees will be briefed on the programmes again tomorrow.The country\"s main civil liberties organisation wasn\"t buying the Administration\"s explanations, filing the most significant lawsuit against the huge phone record collection programme so far. The American Civil Liberties Union and its New York chapter sued the federal government in New York, asking a court to demand the Obama Administration end the programme and purge the records it has collected.Polls of US public opinion show a mixed response. A poll by the Washington Post and the Pew Research Centre conducted over the weekend found Americans generally prioritise the Government\"s need to investigate terrorist threats over the need to protect personal privacy.But a CBS News poll showed while most approve of government collection of phone records of Americans suspected of terrorist activity and internet activities of foreigners, a majority disapproved of federal agencies collecting the phone records of ordinary Americans.Thirty per cent agreed with the government\"s assessment that the revelation of the programmes would hurt America\"s ability to prevent terrorist attacks, while 57 per cent said it would have no impact.AP"}, "TG_6320": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Patient data must be safeguarded The effective use of patient data is of critical importance to improving healthcare delivery, service design and medical research in the NHS.

Some analysts said that anger has lessened as terrorist threats against the USA by the Islamic State and other extremist groups have gained attention.\"In the past five or six months, we have witnessed heightened U.S. national security concerns with terrorist threats, geopolitical problems, and cybersecurity challenges from Russia and China,\" said David Fidler, professor of law at Indiana University's Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research.The bill was sponsored by a rare bipartisan coalition of senators ranging from liberal Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The measure did not go far enough to satisfy some privacy advocates, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. It was opposed by hawkish lawmakers who argued it would hamstring intelligence agencies when terrorist threats  are rising.Major U.S. tech companies pushed for its approval, complaining that the NSA controversy has made it hard for them to convince foreign customers that they will not be spied upon by the U.S. government if they use U.S. phone or Internet providers.The vote came as Americans are increasingly worried about their privacy. More than 70% of adults are concerned that the government may be accessing personal information from their social networking sites without their knowledge, according to a survey released last week by the Pew Research Center.Leahy, lead sponsor of the Freedom Act, said Americans \"continue to demand stronger protections for their privacy.\"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the bill would hamper  U.S.  ability to protect Americans.

The commission wants the member states to work together to impose rules and regulations governing offline campaigning to be applied to the digital world.The move follows the scandal first reported by the Observer of the harvesting and sharing of the personal data of tens of millions of people by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has admitted that the data of           87 million users may have been improperly shared, including that of 1 million users in the UK.Jourov said the scandal offered a \"clear warning sign\" that election periods were particularly prone to disinformation and manipulation by private and foreign interests and that next May's European elections were not immune to the threat.The campaign for that poll are expected to be dominated by a clash between those promoting the nationalist and anti-immigration policies of Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and Hungary's prime minister,           Viktor Orbn, and those backing a pro-European agenda, led by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon is seeking to create a large far-right bloc in the European parliament. Cambridge Analytica executives boasted of playing a key role in bringing Trump to power.Jourov said: \"Our current electoral rules, practices and habits stem from our non-digital past, [such as] campaign spending limits, strict rules on [political] advertising, including transparency on who is campaigning and who paid for this.\"The Oxford Internet Institute, part of the University of Oxford, published a report this year that found evidence of formally organised social media manipulation campaigns in 48 countries, up from 28 in the previous year.Jourov, who is a politician from the Czech Republic, said: \"One thing is clear: the upcoming elections will not be business as usual and we cannot treat them as if they were.\"The commission recently published an EU-wide code of practice on disinformation to encourage social media sites to limit the \" micro-targeting \" of voters and to make the funding of such campaigns more transparent to users.It also wants support for an independent network of fact-checkers and action to stimulate quality journalism and promote media literacy.Julian King, the security commissioner, said internet platforms such as Twitter and Facebook had a responsibility to defend the integrity of elections by \"shining a light\" on the sources of information on their sites.He said: \"The Cambridge Analytica case has thrust into the spotlight an array of threats to our elections: hacks, leaks, fake news, as well as the misuse of personal data.\"King said the code of practice established by the commission for internet platforms was voluntary but that legislation in the future had not been ruled out if results did not follow.He and Jourov were taking part in a debate in the European parliament before a vote on Thursday on whether to back measures such as a full audit of Facebook or changes to its platform to avoid future privacy violations.Conservative MEP Dan Dalton said the results in recent contentious polls should not be blamed on digital manipulation alone.\"Brexit and Trump happened because many felt the political system was not working for them,\" he said. \"Claiming the voters were duped by posts on Facebook is merely an excuse for not addressing those very legitimate concerns.\""}, "SMH_3378": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Security bill undermining our liberty The National Security Amendment Bill (No.1) 2014, introduced into Federal Parliament last month, is 128 pages long. The bill's explanatory memorandum is larger again - 167 pages.It's a behemoth - complex, labyrinth and, to outsiders, opaque. In that sense, the bill is a great metaphor for the massive national security apparatus that has developed since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.It's also the first major piece of Australian national security law reform since Edward Snowden a year ago revealed the United States' program of global, indiscriminate mass surveillance.Timing matters. The Snowden revelations showed that not everything done in our name is done in our interest and often it is done without any democratic scrutiny, let alone the approval of voters.So what should voters make of the Abbott government's new national security bill?The three most significant elements are a new power to allow spies to plant software on targeted computers, new penalties for intelligence whistleblowing, and a prohibition on anybody releasing information about \"special intelligence operations\".But it isn't clear what the practical implications of these powers are. Are there any boundaries on what constitutes a special intelligence operation? Could journalists be prosecuted for reporting on national security leaks? Getting details out of the government is like pulling fingernails.National security is a unique area of public policy. It's one of the most important functions of government, yet citizens have very little idea of what the government does under the guise of protecting them.So the debate over national security powers is always held under a veil of ignorance. Usually serious public policy discussion requires evidence, but when we're talking about security, those evidentiary standards go out the window. The best we get is hand-waving about terrorism and, now, Australian residents fighting in Syria. We're told to take the government on trust.Given that a basic principle of democracy is that governments must justify themselves to the citizenry, this is a problem. Terrorism is a threat, but it is not a blank cheque for legislative change.The democratic accountability problem is enhanced even further by the fact that, as the Snowden leaks showed, Western governments have repeatedly lied about their national security actions and kept hidden evidence of their own wrongdoing.In his recent book, Secrets and Leaks: the Dilemma of State Secrecy, Princeton academic Rahul Sagar argues there are no easy ways to impose democratic accountability on the national security state.Blind trust isn't an option. Democracies cannot rely on blind trust. Unfortunately, radical openness isn't an option either. We don't want the bad guys to know everything about ongoing enforcement operations.Institutional accountability mechanisms, like parliamentary committees and independent watchdogs, are good, but they tend to be captured by the agencies they are overseeing.Sagar's conclusion is that the best we can hope is that whistleblowers expose wrongdoings.When the US's mass surveillance program was first revealed by Snowden last year, the Obama administration instinctively responded that the program was necessary to prevent terrorism.Yet in December 2013, the administration's own advisory panel concluded that bulk mass surveillance \"was not essential to preventing attacks\" and traditional, targeted surveillance methods were sufficient. This panel was no naive civil libertarian whitewash. One member was even a former CIA deputy director.A study by the New America Foundation, a think tank partly funded by the US government, concluded that mass surveillance \"has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism\".Australia is one of the members of the US's Five Eyes surveillance coalition, alongside Canada, Britain and New Zealand. Our governments have been no more honest than US administrations about the need for new security powers.For instance, the government claims its national security bill is mostly just a long-overdue update of 1970s-era telecommunications interception law, but this argument would be more plausible if the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 had not been updated more than 50 times in the past two decades.The bill is apparently the first of a series. Attorney-General George Brandis said last week a second tranche of reform would make it easier to prosecute Australians fighting overseas, and make it illegal to promote terrorism. OK, but it's already illegal to incite terrorism. Is that not enough? Will the government explain why changes are needed? Don't hold your breath.A third tranche is likely to introduce mandatory data retention. That policy would require internet service providers to record almost everything every Australian does on the internet, just in case law-enforcement agencies decide to have a look. Mandatory data retention is expensive and repressive.There will probably be a fourth tranche. Tony Abbott wants to be a tough-on-terror prime minister.The Snowden revelations teach us that the burden of proof rests on those who say we must trade our liberty and privacy for security. That burden has not been met."}, "NZH_4381": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Hauraki Breakfast Show fined $8k for airing complaint NZME Radio has been ordered to pay a fine and compensation totalling $8000 for breaching broadcasting standards.The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) has ruled hosts on the Hauraki Breakfast Show seriously breached standards when they intentionally broadcast live on air a caller who had asked to make a complaint off air.The BSA has ordered NZME Radio to pay $4000 in privacy compensation to Deborah Stokes, $4000 in costs to the Crown and to broadcast a statement summarising the Authority\"s findings.Stokes, the mother of New Zealand-born English cricketer Ben Stokes, called the station to complain about comments made by the hosts regarding her son, and to defend him.

According to Police statistics, between 2008 and 2011 New Zealand experienced 153 murders. With an average resolution rate of 91.43 per cent that meant 13 murders went unresolved-13 murderers got away Scot free.During the same period 8,895 sexual assaults took place and with an average resolution rate of just 61 per cent this meant 3,467 perpetrators also got away scot free.Although your chances of being personally involved in a serious crime are extremely low statistically, crime is still a concern to most of us. We all know that rapists, child molesters and murderers are walking free in public, yet to be caught and pay the price for their crimes.We would all like to see crime reduced and the perpetrators brought to justice.Steven Spielberg\"s 2002 movie Minority Report, featuring Tom Cruise, was a futuristic science fiction, come whodunit movie, where a specialised police department catches criminals based on foreknowledge provided by three psychics called \"precogs\". Their precognitive abilities and the ability for the PreCrime division to get there in the nick of time, by tracking potential murderers with the city\"s optical recognition system, made Washington DC murder-free for six years. While the Minority Report was a fantasy, New Zealand Police do have the potential to solve far more crimes than they currently do-but the law does not yet go far enough to allow them to do so. It could go further but civil libertarians have already been up in arms and out in force to limit progress in this area, a good example being the Search and Surveillance Bill which has just passed its second reading in parliament.The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Amendment Act came into force in September 2010. This law allows police to take DNA samples from a wider range of serious offenders, such as anyone they intend to charge with an imprison-able offence.Just imagine though, how many crimes would be solved and how many perpetrators of heinous crimes would be brought to justice, if Police were able to search a database of DNA taken at birth from every New Zealander or new immigrant?Would this be crossing the line between civic rights and civil rights? Where do you draw that line? Is protecting society more important than some civil rights? What harm could it do?Some would argue that taking DNA from every New Zealander at birth would be contrary to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act provision against unreasonable search and seizure. During the process of this legislation one politician said taking DNA from a person not being charged would be a \"gross assault\" on that person. Knowing your chances of getting caught just got higher might even act as a bigger deterrent to criminals?DNA profiling has revolutionised the way the police solve crimes. In 2000, a study by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research pointed out that, \"Of all DNA profiles loaded from unsolved crimes, 33 per cent match an individual whose DNA profile is present on the National DNA Database. In addition, 21% of unsolved crimes loaded match another crime present on the Crime Sample Database.\"There are also other positive aspects, in America DNA testing has cleared approximately 25 per cent of sexual assault suspects whose samples were sent to the FBI.Convictions have also been overturned and innocent people released from jail because of DNA testing. DNA profiling was paramount in the capture of serial rapist Malcolm Rewa and over 3000 men who fitted the Police offender profile were excluded with this tool after voluntary samples were obtained.There are however those who have concerns over the security of DNA samples. For example, DNA could be \"planted\" by police to ensure a prosecution. It could also be used for other purposes yet to be discovered which could amount to an invasion of privacy.Insurance companies could get access to this information and refuse to insure people, or employers may deny employment. Future governments could use it to deny the right to have children because new DNA developments could make it possible to detect the likelihood of criminal offending?These are all aspects that need to be seriously considered if such a process were to take place, but aspects that could surely be protected with the appropriate legislation and security.One stumbling block that has faced European governments on DNA testing is a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. In 2008 it ruled unanimously that keeping the genetic information of innocent people indefinitely was a violation of the right to privacy.Although privacy is a right in a democratic society, it is certainly not an absolute right. Some might consider DNA profiling of the whole country as the first step towards a totalitarian state, but just perhaps, this concept, along with the Search and Surveillance Bill passing the final hurdle, could be the first steps towards a state that will not tolerate crime -a state that will do everything possible to protect the innocent.* Steve Baron is the Founder of Better Democracy NZ, a former businessman and Waipa Mayoral candidate."}, "NZH_4367": {"true_label": "11", "text": "Colleague browses through private health information An employee at a large health agency in New Zealand has had her private health information - including her \"extremely sensitive\" emergency department and mental health records - accessed by more than one former colleague.The woman\"s private information was looked at on numerous occasions between 2012 and 2013, case notes from the Privacy Commissioner\"s Office show.She was notified about the offending by the health agency and told her former colleague had been fired as a result.Both parties had worked in administrative roles and had access to health records and medical information.But it was only when the woman asked for an access audit to be conducted that she found more than one person had \"browsed\" through her private information.The offending \"showed a pattern of behaviour and gave meaning and context to some comments her former colleagues had made about her health while they worked together\", Privacy Commissioner John Edwards said.He said the woman had asked for an audit of access to her records after finding out they had been accessed without proper reason, \"so she could be sure no other staff she had worked with had inappropriately accessed her health information\".Mr Edwards said the audit revealed another former colleague had browsed her health information during the same time period.The fact that people she worked with were responsible heightened the complainant\"s feelings of violation and humiliation.Privacy Commissioner John Edwards\"This was especially distressing for the complainant because it renewed the complainant\"s concerns that her colleagues had treated her unfairly and had been sharing her sensitive health information with each other.\"He said Rule 5 of the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 requires an agency to ensure reasonable security safeguards exist to prevent loss, unauthorised access or disclosure of the health information it holds.\"Assessing what is reasonable depends on the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information involved and the ease with which safeguards could be put in place to protect the information. The agency\"s current policies and practices, including any staff training, are also relevant.\"The information accessed was shown to include \"extremely sensitive\" emergency department and mental health records.Edwards said under Rule 5, an agency has an ongoing responsibility to develop and maintain appropriate security safeguards for their information.\"System audits, staff training, policies and technology upgrades are some of the tools an agency can employ to help maintain a good privacy culture and ensure trust and confidence in the security and privacy of health information.\"Inappropriate access to information by employees, called \"employee browsing\", is a problem for many large agencies.

On one side is the Abbott government, with its law enforcement and security agencies, which are fighting to preserve access rights to communications data that have been legally in place for decades. These rights are being diluted by technology change and the absence of formal data retention laws.On the other side are the increasingly diverse array of communications carriers - which are required to hand over this information, but may not want to continue paying to store it - and anarchists and libertarians that want to question and/or repeal the government's existing authorities.Agencies' metadata access rights are prescribed under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 2007, which is the latest iteration in a long line of limiting laws that were first introduced in 1960 to protect our privacies from public surveillance.The 2007 amendments were made following a review that found there was inadequate regulation of agencies' access to communications data and insufficient protection of privacies when that information was obtained, stored again and then discarded.Recent media controversy has arisen because in seeking to ensure companies retain metadata the government has traditionally been able to utilise, it has had to more explicitly define what it means by the term. The conventional definition of metadata is the transactional \"footprint\" of a communication, such as the names, addresses, phone numbers, email identifiers (including the email address and the computer's internet protocol (IP) address) and the geolocation of the communication. It excludes any substantive \"content\", which is taken to mean the verbal conversation, email subject line or any other matter that constitutes the written or verbal dialogue.Understandable resistanceOne grey area had been whether external IP addresses that a person visits - as opposed to their own - would fall within the metadata remit. The understandable resistance to encompassing third-party IP addresses is that it would permit agencies to track without a warrant the internet destinations an authorised target had frequented, and provides a far more granular picture of their pattern of life beyond what they had in the pre-internet days.When the Communications Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, discovered that cabinet's National Security Committee, which he is not a member of, had resolved to push forward with legislation mandating metadata storage for two years - a policy Turnbull supports - it was clear that non-technical stakeholders, such as Attorney-General George Brandis and Prime Minister Tony Abbott, did not understand where the metadata definition started and finished.Neither Brandis nor Abbott should have been spruiking the policy without an unambiguous handle on its practical and legal meaning. There is also a case that Turnbull should have been included, one way or another, in the NSC deliberations in the same way his predecessor, Stephen Conroy, was under Labor.In a meeting with the peak security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies last Thursday, Turnbull was able to finally settle the metadata definition, which - contrary to both Abbott's and Brandis's claims - did not capture the IP addresses of websites. Turnbull was thereafter unleashed alongside the AFP and ASIO to explain the proposal.After engaging with our carriers, Turnbull thinks that most, but not all, are keeping the metadata the agencies are allowed to tap if they believe it is \"reasonably necessary\" for the enforcement of a criminal law, the legal imposition of penalties, the protection of government revenues, national security and/or foreign law enforcement reasons.There are, however, still two concerns: first, carriers may not continue doing so as their storage capacity is met (or costs dictate); and second, there are some firms that are simply not satisfying the government's standards. The proposed legislation addresses these needs.Communications data retention policies exist in one form or another in many countries throughout the world, including liberal-democracies in North America and Europe (and the UK). They are more pervasive in non-democratic states such as China and Russia and throughout the Middle East and Africa, where there is little public debate and heinous violations of freedoms that Western communities take for granted.US reforms mirror Australian approachUS President Barack Obama, who was a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, declared in a January speech: \"I believe it is important that the capability that [the US metadata] program is designed to meet is preserved.\"In defending intelligence agencies' \"valuable\" and \"necessary\" bulk metadata collection, which had \"generated the most controversy\", Obama explained that after a review by top civil libertarians and constitutional lawyers, which \"turned up no indication [the] database has been intentionally abused\", he was implementing reforms that mirror the Australian approach.Instead of government collecting bulk metadata, private companies will be required to retain the information, which can then be queried on a targeted individual basis.There is a vital democratic debate Australians should continue to have to ensure surveillance powers are only used when necessary and are subject to unfettered oversight by Parliament and its proxies.Currently, the oversight regime includes, but is not limited to, the Inspector-General of intelligence and security, the National Security Committee of Cabinet, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Ombudsman and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.If there is a persuasive argument for more constraints on, and monitoring of, agencies without unacceptable costs to the security of our liberties, the majority of Australians would doubtless support it."}, "TDP_2458": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Privacy concerns United StatesAmazon has been accused of watching footage from its customers' security cameras which is likely to re-ignite concerns over whether the tech giant is violating people's privacy.

But McAfee, which was recently acquired by Intel, declined to say which country it believed was behind the attack.''We're not pointing fingers at anyone, but we believe it was a nation-state,'' Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee's vice president of threat research and the lead author of the report, said by telephone on Wednesday.Organizations in the United States constituted 49 of the 72 targets, McAfee said, while governments, companies and organizations in Britain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan also were attacked multiple times.''After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the 14-page report.Among the few targets mentioned by name in the report are the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The report comes after a series of high-profile cyberattacks aimed at the International Monetary Fund, Sony and Lockheed Martin, the United States' largest military contractor.McAfee said it released the report to coincide with the start of the Black Hat technical security conference in Las Vegas. Briefings at the conference, an annual gathering of security professionals, were scheduled to be delivered Wednesday and Thursday.The company said it had alerted victims of the attacks and had also informed law enforcement agencies, which were investigating the intrusions.However, Mark Adams, a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee, said, ''We are unaware of the alleged attempt to compromise our information security claimed by McAfee. If true, such allegations would of course be disturbing.''He added, ''The I.O.C. is transparent in its operations and has no secrets that would compromise either our operations or our reputation.''Spokesmen for the United Nations and the World Anti-Doping Agency could not be reached for comment.In its report, McAfee said it learned of the hacking campaign last March, when it discovered logs of attacks while reviewing the contents of a server it had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies.It dubbed the attacks ''Operation Shady RAT'' - RAT stands for ''remote access tool,'' a type of software used to gain access to computer networks.The earliest breaches dated from mid-2006, though McAfee said there might have been other intrusions still undetected. The duration of the attacks ranged from a month to what McAfee said was a sustained 28-month attack against the Olympic committee of an unidentified Asian nation.What was done with the data ''is still largely an open question,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the report. ''However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team's playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.''Asked why McAfee decided not to identify most of the corporations that were attacked in ''Operation Shady RAT,'' the company said on Wednesday that most corporations were worried about being identified and alarming shareholders or customers.Cyberattacks have heightened overall concerns among government officials and corporate executives, who are being warned about the sophistication of the attacks and the ability of hackers to gain access to sensitive corporate and military secrets, including intellectual property.In some attacks, the culprits are believed to be professional hackers engaged in disrupting an organization's operations for the sheer pleasure of it, or in a search for revenge.In mid-May, the administration of President Barack Obama proposed creating international computer security standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. The strategy called for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with standards aimed at preventing theft of private information and ensuring Internet freedom.Obama administration officials said privately at the time that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property theft and enacting stricter laws to protect computer users' privacy.There are also growing concerns that some cyberattacks are being carried out by governments, particularly after Google said last year that Chinese hackers had stolen some of the company's source code. Many security experts say the Chinese government has built up a sophisticated cyberwarfare unit and that the government may be teaming up with professional hackers.In February, a Canadian cabinet minister said that hackers, perhaps from China, had compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet access for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell B. Day, the president of the Treasury Board, called the attack a ''significant one'' that went after financial records.Also in February, McAfee released a report saying that at least five multinational oil and gas companies had suffered computer network attacks by a group of hackers based in China.Beijing has strongly denied any role in cyberattacks and insisted it has been a frequent victim of cyberattacks. On Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment about allegations of Chinese links to cyberattacks following the McAfee report.But last month, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Hong Lei, said, ''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.''He added, ''Hacking is an international issue, with which China also falls victim. China is willing to conduct international cooperation in this regard.

There\"s not.\"Police have also noticed a surge in private surveillance taking place and then being published.They have used private footage themselves, such as in the case of an incident in February when a woman was grabbed on a suburban Auckland street and pulled into a car, before escaping soon after.A car was spotted on a nearby home\"s surveillance camera and a man arrested and charged.National Crime Prevention manager, Superintendent Eric Tibbott, said home surveillance could be a useful tool for crime prevention and community safety.But use must be lawful, fair and not unreasonably intrusive, Tibbott said.Advice on the Privacy Commissioner\"s website on the use of surveillance cameras includes making sure neighbours are aware of cameras and letting them view footage if requested.Whether footage could be used as evidence depended on the legality of the recording, Tibbott said.He also urged care when posting surveillance footage on social media.Facebook community pages are frequently used by residents to post screengrabs of what they believe to be suspicious behaviour on their properties, and while social media could be a powerful tool, all information on crime and suspicious activity should be reported to police, he said.\"This ensures inquiries are undertaken to make sure information is verified, and that potential offenders are held accountable where possible.\"Posts on offenders could also jeopardise criminal investigations and any subsequent court process that may take place, Tibbott said.Fortress Security director Steve Roberts said it was also important to learn how to protect yourself.The cameras could be hacked, putting at risk those on the other side of the lens.Overseas media have reported creepy incidents in which home surveillance cameras, including baby monitor cameras, have been hacked.The footage, including of sleeping children, has then been broadcast live on the internet.Updates should always be installed and default user names and passwords changed, Roberts said."}, "TG_11239": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Court allows police to reveal acquittals during record checks;Ruling means employers can be told of criminal charges that an individual has faced Police forces can reveal whether individuals have been acquitted of criminal charges when issuing information for enhanced record checks, the supreme court has ruled. The decision establishes new guidelines in balancing an individual's right to privacy when applying for employment against the need to protect public safety.The legal challenge was brought by a man identified in court only as AR, who was married with children and of previous good character. He was a qualified teacher but had been working as a taxi driver.  In 2011, he was acquitted of rape by a crown court. His defence was that there had never been sexual contact with the victim. Following his acquittal, he applied for an enhanced criminal records certificate (ECRC) during an application for a job as a lecturer. The ECRC that was issued contained details of the rape charge for which he had been acquitted. AR objected to the disclosure on the basis that there had been no conviction and that it failed to give a full account of the evidence and how the jury came to its conclusion.An ordinary criminal records certificate is limited to the facts of any convictions, police cautions or their absence. By contrast, an ECRC includes information on the basis simply of the chief constable's opinion whether it \"ought to be included in the certificate\". Delivering the unanimous ruling, Lord Carnwath said: \"Given that parliament has clearly authorised the inclusion in ECRCs of 'soft' information, including disputed allegations, there may be no logical reason to exclude information about serious allegations of criminal conduct, merely because a prosecution has not been pursued or has failed. \"In principle, even acquittal by a criminal court following a full trial can be said to imply no more than that the charge has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In principle, it leaves open the possibility that the allegation was true, and the risks associated with that.\" But, Carnwath added, the cases raised questions about how employers are supposed to handle such revelations. \"We have been shown reports which emphasise the importance of not excluding the convicted from consideration for employment, but they say nothing about the acquitted, who surely deserve greater protection from unfair stigmatisation,\" he noted.\"Nor does there appear to be any guidance to employers as to how to handle such issues. Even if the ECRC is expressed in entirely neutral terms, there must be a danger that the employer will infer that the disclosure would not have been made unless the chief officer had formed a view of likely guilt.\"Mike Pemberton, a partner at the law firm Stephensons who represented AR, said he was considering appealing against the decision. \"This was an important case which examined whether an acquittal should be disclosed on an enhanced criminal records check. My client is very disappointed at the dismissal of his appeal and findings that disclosure of the information was proportionate. \"He has continuously struggled to pursue his chosen career since the allegation of rape was made against him and he was found not guilty following trial due to the continued disclosure. The supreme court only granted permission to appeal in respect of the right to privacy and did not consider the presumption of innocence. We are now considering whether to make an application to the European court of human rights in respect of both these issues.\" Stefano Ruis, a solicitor at the law firm Hickman and Rose, said: \"Today's judgment represents another nail in the coffin for the presumption of innocence. [It] indicates support for the notion that the police do not need to believe that the allegation is more likely than not to be true when deciding whether to disclose it, even where the allegation led to an acquittal. \"This means that, even after being acquitted by a jury, an individual can still face the penalty of losing their job or employment prospects. After acquittal, there is little more an individual can do to prove their innocence and today's decision accepts that such disclosure amounts to a killer blow for those in particular types of work.\" "}, "TS_5414": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Taking the pledge to protect voter privacy A century ago, Canadian campaigns were a cesspool: bribery, violence, corrupt politicians using corrupt journalists to sell lies about each other, ballot stuffing, cash for votes and lots of free booze. Decades of reformers' struggle weaned our politics of most of the dirty deeds.Now a few digital tycoons are threatening to drag us back into the ditch.Elections Canada was already concerned about how to control illegitimate offshore players, buying access to voters using social media, before the Facebook scandal erupted. They have been holding expert round tables and discussions with peers in other countries and with the parties about how to defend our hard-won electoral safeguards. But now we appear to have entered an entirely new, darker place.Micro-targeting voters has been around for two decades: postal codes and census data, and tracking magazine and cable usage. Parties bought data for exclusively male, heavy baseball watchers, under 30, and then chose the best message and delivery vehicle. American campaigners under much looser privacy laws could buy more than 20 separate data points about you as a voter, including mortgage information, criminal convictions and divorces.But in no case until now, legally, could you acquire millions of images, personal notes and data, your deepest personal information, such as appears on too many na#239;ve Facebook users' pages. Now we know you can.Part of the original cesspool cleanup process involved candidates and parties taking a \"no booze or cash\" pledge publicly, at the urging of groups such as the League of Women Voters and church and labour groups.Later, parties accepted that they could not use patronage to tilt election counts overseen by their own partisans, and pledged to support professional selection of election officials. Only much later did legislation catch up with the new ethics that voters had forced on the politicians.Perhaps it's time for voters to demand that parties take the pledge again?Should voters not demand that those seeking their votes publicly promise they will never use private personal data as a campaign tool, that they will not buy any such data no matter how or where acquired? They will not use media or social media platforms that do not offer credible protections against the misuse and sale of their data? Why not make the same demand of suppliers and the tech companies themselves: \"Otherwise, we will not buy from you or advertise with you.\"We clearly do need tougher legislative protections for our political process in the digital age. But we are very unlikely to get them, let alone have them legally tested, before a set of important elections across Canada. We have an election in Ontario in a few weeks, elections in Quebec and B.C. likely this year, big city elections later this year and Alberta and a federal election in 2019.The problem with cleaning up any electoral process - as with any corrupt practice - is that unless everybody agrees, and is seen to comply, huge benefits remain with the rule breaker.The reward for the one who, \"Just this one last time,\" plays the Russia/Cambridge Analytica game with fake quotes and videos sent anonymously to voters whose vulnerability has been gleaned from stolen private data is very high. As the British and Americans have learned to their cost - it works! None of our upcoming campaigns can be judged free of taint unless some promises are offered by the players in advance, and then tracked by both civic groups and our elections officials.The damage inflicted by these greedy and unethical consultants and their billionaire backers is still unfolding. The harm they will have done to democracy in the U.S. will linger for years.Do we not think we are vulnerable to pipeline propaganda - from both sides - to be used in several of the upcoming campaigns, perhaps funded and delivered by pro and anti- groups in the U.S. and elsewhere. Is the prospect of racist sneers against many candidates and one party leader, not a real prospect from those who played that role in Brexit and in electing Donald Trump.Canadians should not wait until we too have been stung before demanding action.Robin V.

Helena Pozniak says having a plan is key Mumsnet now has levels of online security on a par with what you might expect from your bank - but then the popular parent site has been hacked twice.Privacy is at stake because some Mumsnetters air their innermost thoughts online, believing they are protected by anonymity. So when cybercriminals hacked the site in 2014 and 2015, 1.5 million users were asked twice to reset their details.Such is the devotion of users that Mumsnet weathered the storm. \"I think we've reclaimed our trust but it was definitely a moment of crisis,\" Mumsnet's head of policy and campaigns, Rowan Davies, told The Telegraph's Festival of Business. Backroom security has been beefed to be with the breached Decoded up and moderators regularly reminded of how easy it is to open the door to cybercriminals.It appears no longer a question of if but when a business will be hacked, say cybersecurity professionals. \"Companies need to be comfortable with the idea of being breached,\" says Sam Nixon, product owner of technology educator Decoded. Information security needs prominence at board level, rather than remaining a backroom operation. \"It's not a hindrance. It's a core part of the business and that's how you need to think about it.\"THE IMPACT OF REMOTE WORKINGA cultural shift has taken place at work, particularly among millennials, says Phil Lander, director of mobile and IT, B2B, at Samsung Europe.Mobile technology means personal life spills into working life and vice versa. And as more employees use their own smartphones for work, a company's systems are potentially more vulnerable to infiltration. \"The working day has changed,\" says Mr Lander. \"More people are accessing systems remotely.\"Last year 46pc of businesses in the UK suffered a cyber-attack, the latest government figures show - nearly twice as many as the previous year. Costs of breaches vary but can prove catastrophic for smaller firms, says Mr Lander. But Samsung's research shows that while 70pc of larger organisations say cybersecurity ranks in their top three concerns, just 30pc of smaller businesses agree.\"But by 2020, 70pc of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to be mobile employees and that changes the shape of the security needs for these businesses,\" he says. \"Research shows that in 2015-16 in the UK alone, businesses spent \u00a310.9m on cybercrime. It's a big problem.\"A TWIN-DEFENCE APPROACHThere are two ways to hack a business: through the technology itself or through the people who work there. And building defences to keep out cybercriminals requires a twin approach along these lines, says Mr Lander.\"We're in an age of digital Darwinism - the internet of things, artificial intelligence, mobilisation. There're so many choices - why not embrace it?\" Samsung, for instance, has just helped TSB to become the first UK bank to install iris recognition technology as a security layer for consumers. \"So the technology is there - you need to find the solution you need.\"But more often than not, human error gives cybercriminals the \"in\" they need to wreak havoc. Mumsnet's second security breach occurred after a phishing attack - a fake message designed to trick an individual into revealing personal information. Thousands of highly convincing scam messages are sent every day - and so individual staff, including increasing numbers of remote workers, need to be kept aware.\"People might feel ashamed that they have been scammed,\" says Ms Davies. In fact, they should broadcast it as an example, and company culture should welcome this, she says. \"Whenever our tech team sees something dodgy - a phishing email, say - they forward it to staff saying 'here's an example of a scam'. Falling for it shouldn't be shaming.\"Attacks are not always online - criminals might gain access through a phone call, even in person, says Mr Nixon. But once they're in a system, passwords are often lamentably easy to crack. \"Phishing is the biggest threat by far faced by organisations, but is rarely used in isolation. Think of it like being conned. Password managers are a cheap solution to this. Or having two-stage authentication - such as having to enter a code from your phone.\"Having a plan when it all goes wrong is also essential, says Mr Lander. And when new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into force next May, businesses will be obliged to report certain security breaches within 72 hours after becoming aware. \"You need to run through potential scenarios,\" he says. \"Each team, from comms to technical, should know their role when the crisis hits.

Bad idea Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot.Today: Domestic use of drones.Bob: President Obama and Congress recently signaled their willingness to allow wider use of drones -- the pilotless aircraft used in  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia against Islamic terrorists -- for domestic purposes. This is Big Brother at its worst. The ACLU and privacy groups have demanded that the Federal Aviation Administration address the \"unique threat\" posed by drones, as well they should.Cal: Hold onto your ACLU card, Bob. I'm with you and civil liberties organizations  that are deeply  worried about government seizing this kind of intrusive and invasive power for itself.Bob: Now there's a first, Cal agreeing with the  American Civil Liberties Union.Cal: Not really. I've sided with them on various issues, including the freedom of expression and even some religious matters. But back to the drones. While these planes have performed well in killing  terrorists overseas, they are the last thing we need flying over America. The technology is so good that they can operate undetected and low enough to identify people attending your backyard barbecue.Bob: I'm surprised how little we've heard from Congress, besides a letter of concern to the FAA from Reps. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Joe Barton, R-Texas.Cal: Maybe that's because there's a congressional \"drone caucus,\" which has 58 members. Many of them have received generous campaign contributions from defense contractors, including General Dynamics, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin (a major manufacturer of drones and missiles that can be attached to them) and Raytheon.Bob: Once again, money wins out over an important  principle:  the right to privacy. The news media tend to report actions by drones when they bomb terrorists, but the planes have several other significant capabilities.  They can also see and capture pictures in the smallest detail from thousands of feet in the sky. They can detect cellphone conversations and other means of communications.Cal: Bad things are often ushered in with good intentions. As constitutional attorney John Whitehead commented, \"Certainly these unmanned vehicles could be used for legitimate purposes, such as search-and-rescue missions, etc., but living as we do already in a semi-surveillance state with our constitutional rights in peril at every turn, these drones, which can be armed with surveillance devices, as well as weapons, are yet another building block in a total control society.\"Bob: Whitehead is right.  Already we have millions of surveillance cameras watching us when we're in public places,  not to mention the Patriot Act, which gives the FBI unprecedented powers to enter homes without  notice,  look at our library cards and much more. These drones are usually operated by the CIA against terrorists abroad. The law expressly forbids the CIA to operate within U.S. borders.Cal: Here's something else to consider:  In 2009,  insurgents in Iraq hijacked Predator drones with a software program that cost $26. They gained access to footage shot by the spy planes. Another potential danger, which even the FAA acknowledges, is  whether drones would add to the air traffic congestion already experienced at major airports. Commercial airline pilots, who also rely on visual flight rules, are concerned about safety hazards from unmanned drones.Bob: Good point.  Let's hope that the FAA listens to the  suggestions for privacy and safety rules from  privacy groups -- and let's hope, too,  that members of Congress put our constitutional rights above special interest money and speak up. President Obama should do so as well.Cal: We are already further along with drones than the public may know. The FAA reform act requires the FAA to create a comprehensive program to safely integrate drone technology into the national air space by 2015. The FAA predicts there could be 30,000 drones crisscrossing American skies by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth $12 billion a year. Dwight Eisenhower was right to warn us against the \"military-industrial complex.\" Drones are just the latest  example of  the industry's intrusions into our liberties.Bob: That's right. In this case,  the section of the FAA reform act that permits  drones in our domestic airspace was written by a lobbyist for the contractors who build drones. I will guarantee you that the members of Congress who inserted that provision in the FAA act have all received political contributions from the makers of drones.Cal: Granted, there can be legitimate uses of drone technology. They can cut costs for police departments and are more effective than helicopters in locating and apprehending armed and dangerous suspects. Since 2005, drones have been used along our lengthy border with Mexico to deter immigrants from entering our country illegally. But permitting the domestic use of drones for these purposes allows the camel's nose under the tent. Do we want our government collecting a constant stream of information on our whereabouts? Drones equipped with Tasers and beanbag guns could fly over political demonstrations, sporting events and concert arenas. The ability of these machines to collect  information is almost unlimited -- and if we allow it to happen, we will have accepted the Orwellian vision of Big Brother. Trying to recover liberties after losing them is like trying to regain your  lost virginity.Bob: In fact, drones have already been deployed to assist local police departments, which on its face may seem like a good idea. But local police don't control the drones; that's done by trained drone pilots in the U.S. military. So  police departments may request assistance on a local crime issue, but who knows what other information is being collected by the U.S. government while the drone is flying over a particular area? On the subject of using drones for domestic purposes, Cal, we have found complete common ground.Cal:  A few groups,  such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, are pushing back. They are filing lawsuits against the FAA, demanding records of the drone certificates that the FAA has issued to various government agencies and research groups. But, says constitutional attorney Whitehead, \"It is unlikely that the implementation of this technology can be stopped. Based upon the government's positions on wiretapping, GPS tracking devices, and Internet tracking technologies, it is also unlikely that our elected officials will do anything to protect the American people from the prying eye of the American government.\"Bob: The potential for abuse from government and law enforcement domestic surveillance by drones is terrifying. And if we're worried about congested air space, just wait until the commercial industry gets into the act. Already drone manufacturers are envisioning use by private companies where the technology might be used for journalistic purposes or disaster relief. But do we really want this technology in the hands of private companies?Cal: And drones aren't the only threat.  As The New York Times reported recently, while Google  was roaming the world's streets with special cameras attached to car roofs for their Street View project, they were also collecting data such as e-mails, chat and instant messages, postings on websites and social networks -- all sorts of private Internet communications. The company says the data collection was a mistake. But combine that technology with domestic drones, and the possibilities for Big Brother intrusion seem limitless. That's what scares me.

Australia has not been spared.\"Some of Mr Snowden's supporters have claimed he is a whistleblower, bringing to light allegedly unethical intelligence gathering efforts by the US and its allies such as Australia.Australia has suffered significantly from the leaks, with revelations it spied on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his wife.Ms Bishop, who met Mr Biden on Wednesday afternoon, said she welcomed President Obama's speech last Friday on a signals-intelligence review.This resulted in modest reforms to US intelligence oversight while controversially retaining the domestic email and phone metadata collection program that is the one initiative Mr Snowden unearthed that does directly intrude on the privacy of US citizens.No domestic reforms needed: BishopYet Ms Bishop defended Australia's intelligence oversight regime and in a later interview with the Financial Review confirmed Mr Snowden's leaks would not drive any domestic reforms.\"Our Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said that he remains satisfied with the robust oversight and collection management arrangements that apply to Australia's intelligence activities,\" she said.\"We believe that Australian intelligence agencies operate in a well-established oversight regime, which includes monitoring by the independent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and accountability to the joint parliamentary standing committee on intelligence and security.\"Ms Bishop also hinted the government would work harder to publicly communicate the otherwise private work intelligence agencies engage in to combat national security threats.\"The collection of intelligence by responsible, democratic governments is not discretionary. It is an imperative in discharging this fundamental duty to protect the safety of their people. In short, it saves lives,\" she said.Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the Snowden leaks and evolution of the internet had dramatically changed national security.\"It raises big political issues,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"The fact one person could take away a reported 8 million files is a complete transformation,\" he said. \"It's no longer the case of the dishonest clerk in the embassy sneaking into the ambassador's office and taking a couple of cables.\""}, "USA_1305": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Common-sense compromise balances security, privacy In the years since the USA Patriot Act was approved in the frantic days following 9/11, it has become steadily more apparent that the law and the way it was applied were an overreaction to those horrific events.The most flagrant abuse is the government's collection of staggering amounts of phone \"metadata\" on virtually every American. That program -- which collects the number you call, when you call and how long you talk -- was secret until Edward Snowden's leaks confirmed it in 2013.Last Thursday, a federal appeals court -- the highest to rule on the issue -- found that the program is illegal. You'd think the unambiguous ruling from a unanimous three-judge panel would finally force changes to the bulk collection program.But that's not necessarily going to happen,  even though a compromise has emerged in Congress that would go a long way toward rebalancing security and liberty.Under the compromise, the data would remain with the phone companies instead of the government. Requests to access the database would have to be far more limited, and each would require approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.The new procedure would eliminate some of the phone collection program's most intrusive features, while keeping the security it offers at a time when the terrorist group Islamic State brings new threats. The measure has support from  Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and a long list of civil liberties and privacy groups.It would also satisfy the court, which didn't dispute Congress' right to create such a program, just the executive branch's right to do so without Congress' assent.Yet instead of embracing the compromise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and others are working to sabotage it.  They want the Senate to ensure that the program will continue just as it is after  parts of the Patriot Act expire at the end of this month.While the phone program's benefits are dubious, its costs are clear. Several major tech companies have said that privacy intrusions  have hurt U.S. companies. Meanwhile, innocent Americans suffer an assault to their privacy each day the government collects data on their calls. And if this sort of collection goes on, history demonstrates the government is likely to abuse it.As the appeals court ruling warned, if the government's interpretation were correct in stretching the law to collect phone data, it could use the same interpretation to \"collect and store in bulk any other existing metadata available anywhere,\" including financial records, medical records, email and social media.Choosing between privacy and security in these dangerous times is difficult. But, despite what supporters of bulk collection insist, lawmakers don't have to choose.A carefully built compromise allows access to phone records, but with genuine privacy safeguards. The nation would be no less secure. And the civil liberties on which the nation was built would be better protected.

''We really need to be extremely cautious, and I emphasize this strongly, not to mix migration process and terrorism.''Part of the complication involves the different kinds of borders in Europe: the outer border, such as between Turkey and Greece, which marks the boundaries of the European Union, and internal boundaries between the bloc's countries, known as the Schengen Area of visa-free travel.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been pressing appeals to Italy, Greece and Turkey to secure Europe's external borders and thus preserve freedom of movement in the Schengen zone.That position is shared by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who on Monday, even after increasing evidence that the attackers came from both outside the European Union and from within it, stressed that erecting walls and fences ''would be the end of Europe.''Despite growing internal pressure to do so, Ms. Merkel has stressed that Germany will not emulate Hungary, which fenced shut its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia. Germany has about almost 2,200 miles of land borders, including a 500-mile border with Austria, where refugees arrive after traveling via Turkey, Greece and the Balkans.Her concerns about protecting Europe's open borders have been matched by the lack of practicality in shutting them, especially in recent months, as hundreds of thousands of migrants took to land routes and trudged from country to country toward the heart of Europe.That human tide has left security forces all along the trail from Greece through Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria with little choice but to let migrants on through to their desired destinations of Germany or Scandinavia.Checks conducted en route vary, leaving the authorities with an incomplete picture.Recent arrivals in Berlin said in interviews on Monday that they themselves favored more security checks. Mobi Clureshi, 24, now helping as a translator at Berlin's main refugee registration center, said he arrived from his native Pakistan via Russia three months ago. He went to Paris shortly before Germany, and said he felt unsafe in its multicultural environment.''I think they allow too many people to get in,'' he said. ''They don't check everyone.'' Fingerprinting should be more widespread, he suggested. ''When you cross a border and you have a system like that, the world would be more secure.''Some 5,000 refugees are arriving daily at the five crossing points between Bavaria and Austria. The authorities try to take everyone's fingerprints and check all identity documents, but the data is not stored because of German legal protections of privacy, Johannes Dimroth, a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry, said on Monday.However, most of the new arrivals are applying for asylum, and are taken to a registration center, where they are formally registered before a much more thorough check and an interview - with a translator if necessary - as the asylum application is reviewed, Mr. Dimroth said.The countries that the migrants enter before reaching Germany have even fewer protections. For Austria, which more than 500,000 people have traveled through this year, only just over 70,000 requested asylum. The large majority are not registered because the country has insufficient infrastructure to do so, Interior Ministry officials in Vienna said, and most migrants refuse to be registered before they reach the country in which they want to settle.In Slovenia, now the most common point to enter Austria after the trek through the Balkans, more than 220,000 people have passed through since Oct. 17, when Hungary closed its border with Croatia and forced the migrants to shift further west.Slovenia has started constructing a razor-wire fence on its 400-mile southern border with Croatia - a measure it insists is not shutting the frontier, but merely controlling the influx and thus enforcing the Schengen zone. Once in Slovenia, migrants are fingerprinted, and in most cases their picture is taken, and their names and documents are entered into a European database. Names are also checked against databanks of criminal records.Many migrants show up without documents at all. They are registered with names and information they give to border personnel, Slovenian officials said. Only 79 migrants so far have requested asylum in Slovenia.Most of the migrants arrive in Slovenia from the Balkan trail that starts in Macedonia and goes to Serbia, which is neither in the European Union or the Schengen zone, but where some 430,000 migrants have been registered passing through this year. Interior Ministry officials declined to say whether fingerprints were taken or personal documents examined. Only 548 people sought asylum in Serbia this year, officials said.Ms. Merkel has failed to win support for swift distribution of refugees amid more countries, and promised registration centers in Greece and Italy are not yet functional. Still, Europeans are taking steps to enhance security, said Mr. Pierini at Carnegie Europe.More police officers from member states will be sent to external borders in Greece and Slovenia, he said, and intelligence services will coordinate and share information.''If the E.U. can get its act together, proper screening of migrants would take place in various countries of entry, starting with Greece - and also Turkey, if they could convince Turkey,'' Mr. Pierini said.''That would be the only way to make sure that people who are migrating to Europe are genuine asylum-seekers, and not terrorist operatives in disguise,'' he said, while adding that ''the risks of that happening among tens of thousands has so far been very low.''"}, "SMH_2358": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Revenge porn: caught in a web of spite Hundreds of Australians - most of them women - find themselves targets. Mark White reports.One morning last October, Tania* clicked on an email at her open-plan workplace. She saw a picture, taken by her estranged husband a few years before, of herself lying on a lounge in her lingerie.The text graphically described sexual activities it said she \"and her man\" liked. It included her new postal address, personal email address and phone number. It said she hosted orgies and to go to her house whenever you wanted. It had been sent simultaneously to everyone in the business.\"You could see the reaction of people and their faces looking at me,\" she says. \"I went beetroot red and could have just died on the spot. I didn't know what to say or do. One of the other managers came over and said, 'You've got to leave the room straight away' and took me into the boardroom.\"Tania went to the police, who said that unless they had the IP address - where the email originated - they couldn't help, though they did take action about texts from her estranged husband, which breached a domestic violence order. Her workplace's IT department removed unopened emails from overseas branches in Britain and Canada, but not before 40 people had seen them.Returning to work the next day was only the start. The police said it was highly possible her picture and details had been uploaded to the internet. She changed her phone and email details but spent weeks wondering if someone would turn up at her house. \"I just used to lock myself in at weekends.\" Luckily, she lives in a gated complex.Tania was sacked not long after and thinks the email was the reason. \"I was in a senior management role. It was pretty difficult for them to look at me in the same way.\" She thinks the only reason her pictures did not go \"completely viral\" was that she is not on Facebook. \"I felt really isolated,\" she says. \"This is supposed to happen to 22-year-old girls, you know, who have no shame. This isn't supposed to happen to a 40-something mother.\"Tania is one of possibly hundreds of Australians - the overwhelming majority, women - who are victims of \"revenge porn\", where former partners post often intimate, sexual pictures taken during the relationship, on dedicated websites or circulate them to family and friends. The idea is to destroy their reputation when someone checks their web presence.Just one site, which Fairfax Media has chosen not to identify, has dozens of Australians listed. Most of the shots - some viewed more than 10,000 times - are pornographic, often with vicious descriptions of the women and crude comments from visitors. You can pay $499 to have your listing removed. About half the Facebook links go to an inactive profile, suggesting the women are aware they are online, but their names still come up in Google searches. Two pictures show a skinny young woman whose forearms are red with blood from the cuts she has inflicted in self-harm. Another site considered revenge porn by activists has close to 400 pictures of Australian women - some clothed, some in lingerie, some nude - with their first name, the first letter of their surname, and the name of their town, with requests for more graphic shots.\"It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It's snowballing,\" says Bekah Wells, who set up the advocacy group Women Against Revenge Porn after intimate photos of her went online in 2010. She keeps having them removed, only to find them posted again. She is trying to serve a lawsuit against her former partner David Avedisian, who she thinks posted the original images, and is suing four websites that have hosted them.\"I wanted to throw up,\" Wells says. \"I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach.\" She thought someone must have hacked her computer - Avedisian wouldn't do that. She then spoke to two other women in her home town of Naples, Florida, who were also on the site. They had all dated Avedisian. She also had to file an injunction against a police officer she had dated, Vito Celiberti. She says he threatened to circulate the photos from her case - after they had split up.\"To some people, I have a big scarlet 'A' on my chest,\" says Wells, 37. She decided to identify herself because she \"felt like I lost my power. I knew by coming forward I would get my power back and that meant everything to me. And secondly, if I didn't come forward, laws aren't going to change.\"The first revenge porn website, Is Anyone Down?, was set up in 2010 by an American, Hunter Moore, described by Rolling Stone as \"the most hated man on the internet\". He has said it received 30 million hits a month, and generated $13,000 a month in advertising. After multiple lawsuits, he sold it last year to anti-bullying site Bullyville, which closed it. But the model - humiliating pictures, personal details, all easily searchable - was taken up by other sites such as PinkMeth, Is Anybody Up? and UGotPosted.They flourished like digital mushrooms in the dark. End Revenge Porn founder Holly Jacobs says her pictures went viral in 2011 and were on 200 websites within three days. Her problems began in 2009 after what she thought was an amicable break-up of a three-year, long-distance relationship. First her Facebook profile was hacked and a nude photo replaced her main picture. Jacobs, 30, confronted former partner Ryan Seay but he said the same thing had happened to him. Six months later, a handful of pictures he had taken found their way to a porn site. Three years after the split, pictures of her - with her email address and a screenshot of her Facebook profile - went viral the day after she posted a shot of her new boyfriend and her on Facebook. She is suing Seay, whose lawyer denies the allegations.Jacobs received about 50 emails, and had to change her address eight times in one year. She says reading them was \"never pleasant ... whether it's someone telling you they saw the pictures and they loved it, and they used it for their own personal pleasure ... it's so disturbing, especially when they send nude photos of themselves.\"Jacobs has been using a take-down service to remove the pictures, which have spread far and wide. \"They've got a lot of it down,\" she says, \"but there are a lot of sites just digging their heels in ... I don't Google my name any more. It doesn't do me any good to relive that trauma.\" She says she has had 1000 victims contact her site in the past year - with Australians the third-highest behind Americans and British.The law can help, depending on what happened and where you live. Last year Ravshan Usmanov, of Sydney, received a six-month suspended sentence for posting nude pictures of his former partner.David Vaile, from the cyberspace law and policy centre at the University of NSW, says some states have similar statutes against publishing \"indecent articles\", and there are also possible federal remedies. He thinks it is time for a breach-of-privacy law - first recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2008. \"The long-proposed right to sue for serious invasion of privacy - this would be the absolute classic case of that.\"Criminal sanctions in the US are limited - Jacobs, Wells and others are pressing for new laws. Texas lawyer Jason Lee Van Dyke filed a suit against revenge porn site PinkMeth last December. When a court order closed it, it moved to war-torn Somalia, which has been without an effective central government since 1991.Van Dyke petitioned authorities in charge of the country's .so suffix who closed it. \"Although I am not Muslim, I did research Islamic law prior to sending my request,\" Van Dyke says, \"and believe that their site violated statutory law as well as Islamic law\".Hollie Toupe's pictures were posted to Texxxan.com. She is now in a class action suit against it with 24 other Texan women. \"A judge ordered the owners to shut it down, the administrators have been ordered not to post or share photos ... We're in the deposition phase with trial set for January.\"Bullyville's James McGibney helped force UGotPosted offline last month, having won $250,000 for defamation from Hunter Moore. \"I'll always be proud of that [taking the sites offline],\" he says.A judge ordered related revenge-porn domain names be transferred to McGibney's company over trademark infringement, awarding him $300,000 in damages plus costs - and finding UGotPosted's proprietors in contempt for breaking an injunction. McGibney now plans a class action on behalf of victims against them.Revenge porn sites have also had to contend with hackers. One site owner tweeted in July that they were \"constantly under attack\". The infamous Anonymous collective has hacked and posted personal details online of site owners, including Moore. \"People,\" wrote one poster, \"Anonymous is a force for good, a force to fight exploitation. It's not just banks, big business and government agencies that exploit. It's assholes like PinkMeth as well ... TAKE DOWN PINKMETH.COM AND KEEP IT DOWN!\"One way to stop revenge porn would be not to have intimate photos taken. But Jacobs says: \"If we did that, we'd never really let our guard down in a relationship - and what kind of life are you living if you can't do that?\"*Not her real nameIf you have been the victim of revenge porn, visit endrevengeporn.com or womenagainstrevengeporn.com"}, "DT_2324": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Merkel attacks US in phone tapping scandal ANGELA MERKEL condemned America's \"unacceptable\" behaviour yesterday after \"firm suspicions\" emerged that United States intelligence agencies had monitored her personal mobile telephone for almost four years. The growing row over US spying could threaten negotiations on a transatlantic trade deal between the European Union and America if Germany insists on privacy safeguards and data protection guarantees that Barack Obama will have a hard time delivering from Congress. The diplomatic row looked likely only to intensify last night after it emerged that at least 35 world leaders had their communications targeted by the National Security Agency (NSA). Documents leaked to The Guardian by the fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden show that the spy agency encouraged other US government departments to hand over their \"rolodexes\" of foreign contacts to be used for targeting. \"In one recent case, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders,\" according to one memo. The 2006 NSA document does not name the 35 leaders and concedes that the telephone numbers yielded \"little reportable intelligence\". The White House refused to address the disclosures, saying: \"We are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations.\" The rift between Washington and Berlin presents a dilemma for David Cameron, who could be forced to choose between his greatest ally, the US, and a German chancellor who is his key partner in attempts to reform the EU. Arriving at a Brussels summit, where Mr Cameron had hoped to strengthen those efforts, Mrs Merkel condemned the US suspected espionage as something that was \"just not done\" between members of the Western alliance. \"It's not just about me but about every German citizen. We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this trust must now be established once again,\" she said. Germany summoned John Emerson, the US ambassador to Berlin, to hear a protest and a demand for full disclosure of the NSA's activities from Guido Westerwelle, Germany's foreign minister. \"I told the ambassador that for Germany it is unacceptable that the mobile phone of our chancellor may have been subject to surveillance activities by our American partners. This undermines trust, and this can harm our friendship,\" said Mr Westerwelle. \"We need the truth now.\" German government and intelligence sources confirmed that it had evidence leading to \"firm suspicions\" suggesting the chancellor's mobile telephone was \"monitored\" by the NSA. According to German sources a Nokia 6210 Slide, supplied by Mrs Merkel's Germany's Christian Democrat party and used by her from October 2009 until July this year, was susceptible to bugging by the US. The number of the Nokia telephone, used for her most private calls, was listed on documents leaked by Mr Snowden. As the US spying scandal emerged this summer, the German leader switched to an encrypted federal government Black-Berry Z10 smart phone, one of 5,000 distributed to officials and diplomats.In marked contrast to other European leaders, Mr Cameron's official spokesman tried to play down the row, insisting that the matter was only a \"bilateral issue\" which would not derail the vital trade talks between the EU and the US. \"There may be bilateral issues that individual countries raise between themselves but in terms of the EU-US free trade agreement this is a multi-national thing and I certainly would not see a connection between those two,\" he said.Nina Schick, of the Open Europe thinktank, said: \"This puts Cameron in a dif-ficult position. The EU-US trade negotiations, in which the UK is investing lots of political capital, could end up as collateral damage in this spat.\" Nigel West: Page 27"}, "TDP_609": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Welfare drug tests may break privacy law NEW REGIME The categories and what they cover:FROM JULY Jobseeker Support (135,100 people): unemployment benefit, sickness benefit, DPB, women alone, and widow's beneficiaries with children over 14.Sole Parent Support (87,100 people): DPB, women alone, widow's beneficiaries with children under 14.

The bill passed its first reading in September but has faced opposition at the select committee hearings, with some claiming it breaches human rights obligations.As part of the reforms, all beneficiaries will be required from July this year to take pre-employment drug tests when requested by a prospective employer. Those who refuse to take the test, or repeatedly fail, will have their benefits cut or suspended.At present, any beneficiary can decline to apply for a job requiring a drug test without facing penalties.Privacy Commissioner Marie Shroff said in her submission that pre- employment drug testing was required by law only for safety-sensitive roles, such as people operating heavy machinery.However, the new welfare regime would not require employers to demonstrate drug-testing was necessary, or even legal, she said. \"Not all employers will comply with the law.\"The new rules would allow the Government to use unlawful drug tests to cut people's benefits.\"Vulnerable beneficiaries will be faced with a catch-22. They are not likely to challenge the legality of a drug test, as refusing to give consent would leave them at risk of having their benefit cut.\"The Human Rights Commission said in its submission that drug tests and sanctions had \"human rights implications\" and would be difficult to implement.\"Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish between drug dependency and recreational drug use . . . [and] it is often hard to show that a positive drug test equates with impairment.\"Social Development Minister Paula Bennett said it would be the responsibility of employers, not the Government, to undertake drug testing.Recreational drug use was already preventing thousands of New Zealanders from gaining employment and adding to the taxpayers' burden, she said. \"It's not good for them, it's not fair on taxpayers.\"Drug addicts or dependants would receive addiction support and retain their benefits.The Human Rights Commission is also deeply critical of other proposed welfare changes that require beneficiaries to meet new \"social obligations\" or risk losing their benefits.Under the changes, beneficiaries who are parents will be required to meet these \"social obligations\", which include enrolling their children in early childhood education and with a health provider, or risk having their benefits halved.The commission said that, rather than helping children, the sanctions would impose additional hardship and poverty.The Government has already red- flagged potential legal hurdles for its reforms. The Justice Ministry \"urgently\" wrote a legal opinion for the attorney-general six days before the latest bill passed its first reading.In the opinion, the ministry said the reforms did not breach beneficiaries' human rights but, if they did, this would be outweighed by better outcomes for children.

He told me, as he told many others, that he regretted only that he had not leaked them earlier, when they might have had more impact and perhaps shortened the war.Whistle-blowing, as Mr. Ellsberg did, is a time-honored means for exposing the secret machinations of the powerful. But the release of huge amounts of hacked data, with no apparent oversight or curation, does the opposite. Such leaks threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful.The latest example of these data dumps comes from WikiLeaks, which is releasing the emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, in dribs and drabs going back to 2008, when Mr. Podesta was the co-chairman of Barack Obama's transition team.\"Wait,\" you might think. John Podesta is about as far from dissident politics as you can get. These leaks have produced genuine news. We finally got to see the text of Mrs. Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, for example. What's wrong with that? Doesn't that serve the public interest?The hacked emails did provide the public with some notable information. But any benefit of such mass data releases does not undo their harm. And that harm is relevant whether or not the data was stolen by a foreign government seeking to influence this election.The victims here are not just Mr. Podesta and the people in his contacts list who are embarrassed or compromised. The victim of leaks of private communication is the ability of dissidents to function in a democracy.Demanding transparency from the powerful is not a right to see every single private email anyone in a position of power ever sent or received. WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its millions of followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide; news outlets repeated the report.Wanton destruction of the personal privacy of any person who has ever come near a political organization is a vicious but effective means to smother dissent. This method is so common in Russia and the former Soviet states that it has a name: \"kompromat,\" releasing compromising material against political opponents. Emails of dissidents are hacked, their houses bugged, the activities in their bedrooms videotaped, and the material made public to embarrass and intimidate people whose politics displeases the powerful. Kompromat does not have to go after every single dissident to work: If you know that getting near politics means that your personal privacy may be destroyed, you will understandably stay away.Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens' emails and personal information in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members. Dissent requires the right to privacy: to be let alone in our vulnerabilities and the ability to form our thoughts and share them when we choose. These hacks undermine that crucial right.Mass data releases, like the Podesta emails, conflate things that the public has a right to know with things we have no business knowing, with a lot of material in the middle about things we may be curious about and may be of some historical interest, but should not be released in this manner.All campaigns need to have internal discussions. Taking one campaign manager's email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing.These hacks also function as a form of censorship. Once, censorship worked by blocking crucial pieces of information. In this era of information overload, censorship works by drowning us in too much undifferentiated information, crippling our ability to focus. These dumps, combined with the news media's obsession with campaign trivia and gossip, have resulted in whistle-drowning, rather than whistle-blowing: In a sea of so many whistles blowing so loud, we cannot hear a single one.What is the right response, then, to living in a world where we will see more mass hacks of information, and more titillating and occasionally newsworthy private communication made public?The answer is not simply to tell people to stop writing things down. \"Don't discuss things over email if you don't want to see them on CNN\" is the new \"don't wear a miniskirt if you don't want to get assaulted.\" That would take us back to the pre-internet world where only the powerful could communicate with ease. People with resources will create their own online gated communities - buying more expensive, secure devices, hiring specialists and flying around more to meet in person - while dissident groups with fewer resources will be left behind.Since these hackers won't stop, we need to build resilience by emphasizing curation, context and ethics, and by no longer acting as if something that has been hacked and dumped is all up for grabs.Journalism ethics have to transition from the time of information scarcity to the current realities of information glut and privacy invasion. For example, obsessively reporting on internal campaign discussions about strategy from the (long ago) primary, in the last month of a general election against a different opponent, is not responsible journalism. Out-of-context emails from WikiLeaks have fueled viral misinformation on social media. Journalists should focus on the few important revelations, but also help debunk false misinformation that is proliferating on social media.Those of us who aren't reporters need better ways to respond, too. These hacks are done to steal our attention and to confuse us; the only effective response is to refuse to play this game on the hackers' terms.In old-school access journalism, journalists trade access for docile coverage, and we are often served gossip or trivia: the kind the powerful would like us to know. In this form of hacked emails, we still get gossip and trivia. But we get the kind the hackers want us to focus on, while distracting us from the real issues.We can't shrug off these dangers just because these hackers have, so far, largely made relatively powerful people and groups their targets.

The case has since been referred to a three-judge panel of Ontario's Divisional Court where hearings may not take place for several months and could overlap with the campaign for the fall election.\"Changes in Bill C-59 set a perilous precedent,\" Ms. Legault said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \"As Information Commissioner, it is my duty to protect Canadians' quasiconstitutional right to know.\"Ms. Legault tabled a report earlier this year alleging that the RCMP knowingly destroyed firearms registry records three years ago even though the information was the subject of an active Access to Information request.That could have resulted in criminal charges being laid against members of the federal force. But the government used the budget bill to retroactively change the law, exempting longgun registry records from the Access to Information Act and effectively letting the RCMP off the hook.In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court this month, an investigator with the Information Commissioner's Office said Ms. Legault will argue that the government's actions violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and the \"derivative right\" of access to government documents. In addition, he said, she will seek a court order saying the government has violated the rule of law and a fundamental principle of a constitutional democracy.The original request for access to all of the records in the Canadian Firearms Registry was filed by a Quebec man in March, 2012, 10 days before the law ending the registry came into effect. Dismantling the registry had long been a promise of the Conservative government, which argued that it was wasteful and intruded on the privacy of law-abiding gun owners.Court documents filed by Ms. Legault's office suggest that, despite assurances from former public safety minister Vic Toews that the documents would be preserved to meet the government's obligations under the Access to Information Act, the government actively encouraged the RCMP to expedite their destruction.In November, 2012, the government announced that all of the gun-registry records had been destroyed except for those from Quebec that were then the subject of a court challenge.Ms. Legault wrote to Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney in March saying the gun-registry information that still existed from Quebec should be turned over to the requester. When Mr. Blaney refused, she asked the Federal Court to ensure that the Quebec documents are preserved until the court challenges have ended.This week, Justice Luc Martineau ordered the government to provide the court with the hard drive containing the Quebec gun-registry data.The government complied with that order, but has made it clear that it is still intent on ensuring the destruction of the long-gun-registry documents.\"The will of Parliament has been clear on multiple occasions; all copies of the obsolete registry are to be destroyed,\" said Jeremy Laurin, a spokesman for Mr. Blaney. \"While complying with the order of the court, we will always stand up for lawabiding firearms owners.\""}, "TDP_1318": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Fears rich would go into hiding behind exemption AUSTRALIA'S tax lobbies say they are happy with the Abbott government's decision to exempt private companies such as James Packer's and Gina Rinehart's from reporting their tax affairs because otherwise rich business owners may go into hiding.James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings is among about 700 private companies that will be excluded from having their tax details published by the Tax Office under draft laws released by the Abbott government which are currently undergoing consultation.A number of submissions to Treasury have been obtained, with the major tax bodies in sync about a carve-out for private companies being necessary.The Tax Institute expressed concern that by publicly disclosing the tax affairs of private companies there was a risk that private information of individual owners would then be sought via searches of Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) public registers.This may force private business owners to go into hiding.\"If this concern is not addressed, private companies may be encouraged to put in place nominee shareholding arrangements to conceal their interests in a private company,\" it said.\"This in turn will result in reduced overall transparency in the public information as to corporate ownership available in ASIC records.\"The submission also argues that the laws result in private companies having to publicly disclose information which can be used to determine their net profit margin.\"Such information can be highly sensitive for businesses and can impact on their business dealings,\" it said.\"For example, the disclosure of this information in relation to a privately owned agricultural business supplying produce to large supermarket chains, may result in their significant customers using the information as leverage in commercial negotiations.\"Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand said in its submission that including private companies could breach individual privacy.\"We are supportive of narrowing the scope of the current measures on policy grounds,\" the submission by its tax leader Michael Croker said.It also took issue with the fact that the draft laws only address privacy concerns for Australian owners of closely held companies, not foreign owners.\"If the disclosed information could be used against them in commercial negotiations, or will give rise to otherwise unnecessary restructuring costs to avoid public disclosures, we query why the amendments are not just extended to all private companies,\" it said.Given the ATO's planned first release of information is for the 2013-14 income year, Chartered Accountants has argued \"there is merit in considering whether the 2014 private company disclosures should be removed from the ATO website and new tables uploaded, given that the 2014 disclosures are intended to have a very long shelf life\".When Labor first introduced the laws before it lost government, it included about 1600 public and private companies with turnover of A$100 million.If the Coalition's amendments are passed by Parliament, only public companies with more than A$100 million (NZ$110m) turnover will be required to report taxable income, total income and tax paid.Business groups have long been arguing against private companies being included, and have lobbied Assistant Josh Frydenberg to change them.Initially the Coalition cited fears that rich people may become greater targets for kidnapping for ransom. This is despite the Australian Federal Police not confirming such a claim. But Frydenberg later said there were commercial reasons for winding back the laws.Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the government was trying to gut tax transparency by shielding almost half of the eligible companies from revealing how much tax they pay.He was also surprised that submissions were not being published on Treasury's website. \"They're [the government are] even being secretive about the process for establishing that secrecy,\" he said. \"You have to ask whose interests they're serving, because this secrecy push certainly isn't serving the Australian community.\" Fairfax--------------------CAPTION:Australian tycoon James Packer is among the rich-listers whose tax affairs wil remain secret under amended laws.Picture: REUTERS"}, "SMH_5009": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Big tech shuns Facebook as ACCC inquiry looms;DATA BREACH Technology companies Google and Twitter are distancing themselves from Facebook's operations in Australia ahead of a world-first inquiry into big internet platforms.The Mark Zuckerberg-led Facebook has been thrown into crisis after it emerged data from 50 million worldwide users was harvested without their consent by Cambridge Analytica, a British-based research firm that helped Donald Trump win the US presidency.Facebook Inc shares posted their steepest drop since 2015 amid calls in the US and Europe for far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.As a result of the scandal, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's inquiry into internet platforms is taking on a global significance. It is examining the influence of internet platforms, particularly the spreading of fake news stories and diverting advertising away from traditional media.Other companies involved in the enquiry on Tuesday expressed concerns about being negatively associated with Facebook.Twitter ANZ head of public policy and government Kara Hinesley said it \"is our hope that the ACCC will examine each company as an individual entity, and take into account the unique nature of each platform's business\".A spokesperson for Google said: \"Google Search is an index of the open internet, which is different to a social platform.\"Yesterday, the Australian privacy commissioner, Tim Pilgrim, for the first time raised the possibility of regulatory action against Facebook in Australia as a result of the breach.\"I am aware of the reports that users' Facebook profile information was acquired and used without authorisation,\" Mr Pilgrim said in a statement.\"My Office is making inquiries with Facebook to ascertain whether any personal information of Australians was involved.\"I will consider Facebook's response and whether any further regulatory action is required.\"In recent months Google has attempted to forge closer relationships with publishers.It recently struck an advertising deal with Fairfax Media (the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald) and has made concessions to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, including a new subscription product.There is growing tension between the digital giants and Facebook over the best way to respond to the global backlash against big tech, according to industry sources.Facebook did not respond to questions about the Privacy Commissioner's inquiries and regulatory threat.The $US500 billion ($650 billion) company declined to make its Australian CEO, Will Easton, available for comment.Facebook's CEO, Mr Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both yet to address the data breach in the US.However, the firm said it takes the \"privacy of people's data and the integrity of our platform very seriously\" and it condemned the actions of Cambridge Analytica in harvesting user data.Labor frontbencher Ed Husic called for a Parliamentary inquiry into Facebook saying the revelations should \"send a chill through people\".\"If parliaments in the UK and the US are demanding action, I don't see any reason why Australia shouldn't expect Facebook to front up and explain itself\" he told the Herald.\"But as is often the case with Facebook, just like what we saw in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Facebook just thinks it can ride this out.\"ACCC chairman Rod Sims was unavailable for comment. A spokesperson for the regulator said it was yet to decide which issues to concentrate on and how to progress the inquiry, but refused to rule out considering Facebook's data breach.An issues paper recently circulated by the regulator said: \"The extent to which consumers are aware of the amount of data they provide to digital platforms, the value of the data provided, and how that data is used is another potential source of concern\".Before the breach, Facebook's submission to the ACCC inquiry was expected to include details on how users understand the information it holds, and the controls users have over how it is used and shared.

There's also Big Business, the busybody across town, the brazen ex and, perhaps, the burglar trolling online hoping to see where we live and what we own.Privacy is under attack in the 21st century as never before. It's the downside to a high-tech communications revolution. Smartphones, digital cameras, laptops, tablet computers, a vast array of web-based social media, GPS and Wi-Fi service all make it remarkably easy to reach out and touch someone. Regrettably, they also make it easier for someone to reach in and tap our private data.Two recent reports - one from Canada's privacy watchdog, and the other from her Ontario counterpart - underline that threat and stress that we shouldn't have to sacrifice privacy to enjoy progress in the digital realm.Among other concerns, Jennifer Stoddart, Canada's privacy commissioner, found that many people's social insurance numbers, passport numbers, banking data and health information were left intact on used computer hard-drives that were resold by a major office supply retailer. More than a third of supposedly clean devices checked by the privacy office had been improperly \"wiped.\"Meanwhile, Ann Cavoukian, Ontario's information and privacy commissioner, reported that many mobile phones and other devices with Wi-Fi are capable of allowing the precise location of their user to be tracked. And it gets worse: that initial user could be turned into an \"unknowing informant\" revealing the location of friends, family members and co-workers.This data can be extremely sensitive, such as if someone visits an HIV clinic, Cavoukian wrote. A location fix \"can reveal damaging and perhaps embarrassing information, or lead to discrimination.\"In a similar vein, others concerned about privacy have expressed worry about risk inherent in \"geotags.\" These are hidden markers embedded in photographs taken by GPS-equipped smartphones and some digital cameras. When the photos are posted online, someone versed in the relatively simple task of reading the geotag can find the exact location where the picture was taken. That includes photos of a new home, or a new television, or of small children.Many Canadians remain blissfully unaware of these and other privacy gaps. More than four in every five are logging onto the Internet, most of them daily, wrote Stoddart.Yet, she continued, \"many people don't know they're leaving a trail of digital bread crumbs when they click their way through websites. They don't know that those crumbs are stored, analyzed and accessible. And they don't understand that this information may be used in ways they never imagined.\"Stoddart concluded that the public needs to be imbued with more \"privacy literacy.\" And she's right. But business needs to do better, too. Cavoukian urged that privacy protection be designed into cellphones, and similar systems, from the start rather playing catch-up in plugging security gaps. That recommendation warrants action.

Could they legally do a search that would let them find that out? Will I be unable to get a job where I handle money? How might this limit my job search? THE ANSWER  Your question is part of the larger issue of what an employer is allowed to ask in interviews.  Bankruptcy should not affect your employment, subject to a few exceptions regarding the type of work involved. If you are an undischarged bankrupt, you might have a difficult time being bonded; also, regulatory bodies and statutes will prevent you from holding specific positions.  The good news is that you are not required to actively disclose your bankruptcy status. The bad news is that a potential employer could ask you to provide a credit check, which would disclose your credit history, previous employers, and how you tend to borrow money and pay off debt. Credit checks are more common in financial and money-handling roles, such as those responsible for handling other people's money or large amounts of money.  If you have concerns about releasing your entire credit history to a potential employer, you should be able to limit what it sees by either providing your own copy, or consenting to provide only part of the information.  Another issue in the news relates to social media and what an employer is allowed to ask, access and see.  There is no law prohibiting an employer from reviewing a job candidate's social networking profiles, and companies often do. Employers can make hiring or firing decisions on the basis of whatever information they find on those public profiles and websites (subject only to human rights prohibitions, including age, race and gender). What about police checks, which include criminal record and police record searches? Most jobs do not require police checks; but teachers, social workers and day-care workers, for example, would be asked to provide one.  In general, a job interview should focus on your ability to perform the job and not involve totally unrelated questions. If you believe your privacy or basic rights have not been respected, you can complain to federal or provincial privacy commissioner's offices, or to a rights tribunal.

Trump and the news media had taken another dreadful turn. He had already vowed to change the libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists, and his personal insults were becoming more vicious. (One news correspondent was a \"sleaze\"; another was \"third rate.\")Most troubling was that he was keeping a blacklist of news organizations he was banning from his rallies, and it was growing.I called him at the time, to see what this would look like in a Trump administration. Would he deny White House credentials to select reporters and news organizations?No, he said. \"There, I'm taking something away, where I'm representing the nation.\"We can only hope he means it. Because if Mr. Trump keeps up the posture he displayed during the campaign - all-out war footing - the future will hold some very grim days, not just for news reporters but also for the American constitutional system that relies on a free and strong press.It's one thing to wage a press war as a candidate, when the most you can do is enforce reporting bans at your rallies, hurl insults and deny interviews and access (all of which are plenty bad).It's another thing to do it from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where you have control over what vital government information is made public, and where you have sway over the Justice Department, which under President Obama has shown an overexuberance in investigating journalists and the whistle-blowers who leak to them.Imagine what somebody with a press vendetta and a dim view of the First Amendment would do with that kind of power.For their part, American newsrooms are conducting their own reassessments, vowing to do a better job covering the issues that animated his supporters, and acknowledging that Mr. Trump tapped into something in the national mood, the power of which they failed to grasp.They now know they underestimate him again at their own peril. Yet they also know that the need to continue with probing, unflinching reporting that promotes the truth in the face of whatever comes at them will be great.In the days immediately after Mr. Trump's victory, journalists that don't work at organizations with Breitbart in their names were preparing for potential reporting challenges, the likes of which they have never seen, while lawyers were gaming out possible legal strategies should Mr. Trump move against press freedoms.Right after his victory Mr. Trump was telegraphing a gentler tone, declaring to  The Wall Street Journal, \"It's different now.\" Perhaps he was making his long-promised \"pivot\" to become \"more presidential than anybody\" save Abraham Lincoln.But then came the Saturday night release of his \"60 Minutes\" interview in which he said he would keep his Twitter account so that when any news organization gave him \"a bad story,\" he would \"have a method of fighting back.\"And he didn't skip a beat on Sunday morning, when he attacked The New York Times with a Twitter post that read, \"Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'\"The statement was false. The paper said Sunday that postelection cancellations were so substantially outstripped by a surge of new subscriptions that its subscription growth rate in the period that followed Tuesday's result was four times the growth rate in the same period of last quarter.In an atmosphere in which it's not shocking to hear about anti-Semitic literature being sent to the home of a Jewish reporter - the address having been published online by supporters of Mr. Trump - it was hard to see any of this as very presidential, though the definition may be changing.The funny thing is that few major political figures have had a more codependent and at times friendly relationship with the press than Mr. Trump. Before he stopped doing news briefings in the later phase of the campaign, he was shaping up to be the most accessible major-party nominee in modern history.But displeasing him could have an intensely personal cost, which the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly vividly recalls in her new book, \"Settle for More.\"Ms. Kelly, who became Mr. Trump's leading television nemesis during the primary campaign, writes about how the candidate, unhappy with a segment she did in July 2015, threatened to unleash \"my beautiful Twitter account against you.\"After enduring her tough questioning at the first presidential primary debate, he made good on his Twitter promise, which in turn led to death threats against her, she said. (\"I would spend many days of the coming months accompanied by security,\" she writes.) It didn't help, she wrote, that Mr. Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, recirculated a Trump supporter's tweet that read \"we can gut her.\"That was followed by what she took as another threat, from Mr. Trump's campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski. As Mr. Lewandowski unsuccessfully lobbied a senior Fox News executive to remove Ms. Kelly from the next Fox debate, she writes, he said he would hate to see her go through such a \"rough couple of days\" again. (Fox News described the conversation the same way earlier this year.)Mr. Lewandowski had been the living embodiment of Mr. Trump's aggressive approach to the press. He was, after all, arrested on charges that he manhandled the former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields. (Prosecutors in Florida ultimately dropped the charges.)After a paid stint at CNN, Mr. Lewandowski returned to the Trump fold last week, and could wind up in the administration or at the Republican Party headquarters.Another member of Mr. Trump's transition team, the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, broke new ground this year by financing the \"Hulk Hogan\" lawsuit against Gawker, which resulted in Gawker's bankruptcy and sale to Univision.Though that was technically an invasion-of-privacy case, it was a model for what Mr. Trump has said he wants to see in opening up libel laws.Most First Amendment lawyers agree that fundamentally changing the libel law would require a reversal of the landmark Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan. And while that might seem like a long shot, Laura R. Handman, a First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview that Mr. Trump could find ways to \"chip away\" at it.First Amendment lawyers are more immediately concerned with potential leak investigations, as well as Freedom of Information Act requests, which can provide the best way to expose government secrets.Look no farther than the potential attorney general candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as mayor of New York was so allergic to records requests that news organizations and others regularly sued him for basic information.Success at court was meaningless given that proceedings kept the information out of public view for so long that \"he really won,\" said George Freeman, who was the assistant general counsel for The New York Times then and is now the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.I've said it before, but the solution will be what it has always been - good, tough reporting.For all the appropriate discussion about how they missed some key dynamics of the race, mainstream news outlets produced a lot of top-flight journalism. They provided a glimpse into the tax returns Mr. Trump wouldn't share; showed how he and Mrs. Clinton ran their charities; investigated their family business dealings; and bluntly called out falsehoods, more of which came from Mr. Trump.The wrong lesson to take from the past year is that reporters should let up in their mission of reporting the truth, wherever it leads.That's more important than ever, given how adept Mr. Trump and his allies have proved to be at promoting conspiracy theories that can spread faster than ever through social media.But if there is one thing we learned this year, it was the wisdom of the old mnemonic device for the spelling of \"assume\" (makes an \"ass\" out of \"u\" and \"me\"). Mr. Trump campaigned through surprise and may well govern through surprise. We'll know how this thing is going to go only when we know.Now, where's my seatbelt?"}, "USA_720": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Commercial drones stir excitement;But others worry about privacy issues Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are no longer confined to the battlefield; soon enough, a civilian market will emerge and share the same airspace with manned commercial aircraft. Remotely operated and GPS-guided, these drones will help monitor storm systems, assist in search-and-rescue operations, track wildlife, survey power lines, deliver goods, broaden photographic possibilities, and trace wildfires.This isn't speculative; it's inevitable, and not everyone is happy about it. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has until 2015 to develop regulations aimed at limiting the myriad privacy and safety concerns associated with UAVs. But given the vast potential of the tech, it's difficult to anticipate exactly what the consumer drone market will look like.\"Part of the reason the skies haven't opened up to private and corporate use of drones yet is because the FAA has been so concerned about safety,\" says Jennifer Lynch, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy advocacy group. \"Drones currently don't have any means of seeing objects around them.\"UAV advocates counter that remote-sensing technology, which is progressing rapidly, will allow drones to autonomously detect and avoid objects. Systems will become lighter, safer and smarter, featuring the ability to automatically sense the location of walls, buildings and aircraft.Scott McTavish, president of Accuas, a Canadian UAV land-surveying company, says the miniaturization of drone sensors is critical to the market's success.\"I think the sense-and-avoid technology and the advancement of sensor technology are really going to advance the industry,\" he says.But lighter, smarter drones are not going to prevent enterprising troublemakers from corrupting the original intent of the technology. Last year, a research team at the University of Texas-Austin demonstrated how the GPS signals guiding a UAV could be hacked and rerouted from the ground -- a potentially dangerous trend in the GPS community known as \"spoofing.\"Earlier this month, a small quadcopter flew within feet of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign rally before crashing onto the stage, raising fears of what a weaponized consumer UAV could do.Mario Mairena, government relations manager for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, maintains that weaponization is strictly prohibited by the FAA. When asked about a video that went viral last year, depicting a man operating a remote-controlled drone with attached machine gun, Mairena responded, \"They're breaking the law, and they should be held account-able.\"Beyond issues of public safety, there are legitimate concerns about personal privacy and surveillance that will likely intersect with questions about First Amendment rights. For example, media organizations and activists may claim the right to use drones for reporting purposes, while privacy advocates may call upon tort law that protects against intrusion and public disclosure.\"In each of those scenarios you could see a privacy claim on the other side,\" says Lynch. \"But we have very strong First Amendment rights in this country, so it's going to be a balance, and probably one that the legislatures will have to deal with.\"Given how alarming UAV technology may seem to some, its advocates agree that regulatory compliance is paramount.Colin Guinn, CEO of DJI North America, which builds aerial drones for photographers and filmmakers, claims his company worked with the Texas state Legislature to frame HB 912 -- a law that limits the use of surveillance drones by both law enforcement entities and private citizens.In the same vein, McTavish argues that if companies want to succeed in this new market, they need to take it upon themselves to respect the concerns of the average citizen, and to abide by all regulations.

I intend to engage and issue guidance to manufacturers, retailers, installers and users to address core concerns. I cannot rule out making recommendations to government if the growing uneasiness continues and guidance is seen as ineffective,\" he said.The commissioner said the most common concern raised with him - accounting for 80% of complaints received - were over the use of CCTV at someone's home. \"The concerns are primarily about the intrusion into a neighbour's privacy.\"He said he recognised that there was sometimes a tension between one person wanting to protect their family and property, and the right to respect for the private and family life of a neighbour.He suggested that people consider installing alternatives to CCTV, such as passive infrared lighting, better external security or a fence.\"If they were following best practice, they would discuss with neighbours before they install,\" Porter said.Guidance to be issued by the commissioner will detail the legal remedies available to those who cannot amicably resolve disputes over the installation of cameras.In the report, Porter also noted the spread of body-worn video cameras beyond the police. Local authorities, residential social landlords and even door supervisors now use the technology, while traffic wardens and environmental officers are amongst those trialing the cameras.The commissioner said it may be necessary to bring the use of body-worn cameras within the regulatory regime once he had assessed their impact on society."}, "TS_2287": {"true_label": "01", "text": "It's up to Ottawa to protect Canadians' privacy Canadian Internet and telecom providers have, for many years, disclosed basic subscriber information, including identifiers such as name, address, and IP address, to law enforcement without a warrant. The government has not only supported the practice, but actively encouraged it with legislative proposals designed to grant full civil and criminal immunity for voluntary disclosures of personal information.Last month, the Supreme Court of Canada struck a blow against warrantless disclosure of subscriber information, ruling that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in that information and that voluntary disclosures therefore amount to illegal searches.The decision left little doubt that Internet and telecom providers would need to change their disclosure policies. This week, Rogers, the country's largest cable provider, publicly altered its procedures for responding to law enforcement requests by announcing that it will now require a court order or warrant for the disclosure of basic subscriber information to law enforcement in all instances except for life threatening emergencies (warrantless disclosures may still occur where legislation provides the lawful authority to do so). Telus advised that it has adopted a similar approach.The change in policy, which should ultimately be mirrored by all Canadian providers, will have a massive impact on how law enforcement operates and on the privacy of millions of Canadians. Simply put, the number of government requests for subscriber information has been staggering, most of which occur without court oversight.A 2011 document supplied to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada advised of 1.2 million requests for subscriber information affecting roughly 750,000 account holders. While that revelation garnered media headlines across the country, a little-noticed 2013 document from Public Safety Canada released under the Access to Information Act indicates that in excess of a million requests annually has been standard for years.The document states that ITAC members (the Information Technology Association of Canada that counts major telecom providers among its members) \"handled 1,130,000 basic subscriber information requests annually from 2006 to 2008.\"As Canadian telecom and Internet providers race to comply with the law by reversing longstanding practices, law enforcement and the government must also catch up. Law enforcement will rarely seek voluntary disclosure (except in exigent circumstances) since it is likely to be treated as an illegal search and the resulting information will be inadmissible in court.Meanwhile, Justice Minister Peter MacKay faces an important decision. With law enforcement not seeking voluntary disclosure of personal information and providers requiring a warrant, the government's proposed immunity provision in Bill C-13 now seems inoperable since it is contingent on a lawful voluntary disclosure, which customer name and address information is not.The Canadian government could adopt the \"bury our heads in the sand approach\" by leaving the provision unchanged, knowing that it will be unused or subject to challenge. That would run counter to the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling, however, and do nothing to assist law enforcement.If the government is serious about providing law enforcement with the tools they need to address online harms, it will drop the voluntary disclosure immunity provision in Bill C-13 and its companion proposal in Industry Minister James Moore's Bill S-4, which seeks to expand voluntary disclosure in non-law enforcement cases.In their place, a new subscriber information warrant could be developed that ensures court oversight, an appropriate evidentiary standard given the Supreme Court's finding of the privacy import of such information, and a system to allow law enforcement to apply for a subscriber information warrant expeditiously.While government MPs were unmoved during committee hearings by repeated expression concerns from experts about the voluntary disclosure provisions, the Supreme Court decision effectively reshaped Canadian privacy law and has forced everyone to rethink longstanding practices. As Internet and telecom providers change their approach, the big question is whether the government is prepared to do the same.Michael Geist holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Law.

A whiff of dystopian creepiness has long wafted in the air whenever facial recognition has come up.Books, movies and TV shows have portrayed the technology as mainly a tool of surveillance and social control - aimed by unseen others at you, for their purposes, not your own.Though several Android smartphones and now Apple's iPhone X have the tech - it remains novel. This year could mark a tipping point in the adoption of facial recognition technology across new areas of our lives - as we shop or communicate with friends and, eventually, as we enter buildings or perhaps turn on our vehicles with a glance rather than a twist of the key.Many forms of surveillance - cellphone location tracking, social media analytics and the CIA's reported ability to remotely activate the microphone on an individual's smart TV - were borne of such popular consumer advances. Only later, typically through leaked documents and investigative reports, did it become clear how popular technologies were turned on their users. \"The big danger with facial recognition is that we are targeted everywhere we go and in everything we do,\" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU. \"The acceptable uses could soften up the terrain for less acceptable uses.\"The potential for widely deployed facial recognition systems has particularly concerned privacy experts, who have warned about a future in which our faces and other biometrics are used to track our every movement, our political activity, our religious lives and even our romantic encounters.Recent research at Stanford, meanwhile, contends that a range of private facts, including an individual's sexual orientation, could be read through sophisticated analyses of facial images with the help of artificial intelligence. The Android devices that use facial recognition keep the data on the device, although hackers have demonstrated that some of these systems can be tricked by photographs of users - something Apple says cannot happen with the iPhone X.Many privacy experts also regard facial recognition technology as a relatively simple, safe and reliable way to authenticate the identity of a smartphone's owner, helping protect the massive troves of personal data kept on devices and giving the technology a positive privacy impact in the view of some experts.\"I don't think we should reflexively reject facial recognition. The question should be, by what means and for whose benefit?\" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre. \"Facial recognition has both good uses and bad uses from a consumer perspective.\"Privacy experts have fsought to raise awareness about the massive commercial databases kept by Facebook and Google, both of which in some circumstances use facial recognition technology to identify people depicted in photos users upload.Also slowing the spread of the technology has been the daunting technical challenges of accurately analysing faces in anything less than optimal circumstances.People in low light, wearing hats or glasses, or simply standing at an odd angle from a camera have long challenged facial recognition systems - as have people with darker skin - leading to false positives and negatives when analyses are made.Apple's system creates what Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, called \"a mathematical model of your face\".\"The chance that a random person in the population could look at your iPhone X and unlock it with their face is about one in a million,\" Schiller said.Nate Cardozo, a senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed less concern than some others that the introduction of facial recognition for device security will erode resistance to other uses of the technology.- Washington Post--------------------CAPTION:Many privacy experts regard facial recognition technology as a relatively safe way to authenticate the identity of a smartphone's owner. 123RF"}, "GM_4722": {"true_label": "01", "text": "OPINION;Canadian consumers need control of their data to level the playing field Chief executive officer of Portag3 Ventures, a Toronto-based early-stage investor dedicated to backing the next generation of global financial services companies'Data is the new gold\" is a popular phrase among the players working to build Canada's emerging digital economy. But unlike the storming of the Klondike, this elusive modern treasure is held and controlled by too few players - and too often for their benefit alone.Canadians must have access to and control of their own data to restore a sense of trust that their privacy is being protected and that they can be the beneficiary when their data are used.A study by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada in 2016 found the vast majority of Canadians are worried that they are losing control of their personal information with 92 per cent expressing concern, including 57 per cent being very concerned, about a loss of privacy. It's fair to say that the regular data breaches we see reported in the news and the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal have done nothing to assuage these concerns.This sentiment should alarm decision-makers: If public trust is lost, the benefits of Canada being a leader in the digital economy could quickly fade away. Canada's enviable leading position (and billions of dollars invested) in artificial intelligence, as an example, could be all for naught.If we don't pro-actively address these sentiments and concerns, we also risk regulatory overreach and draconian policies focused solely on safety and protection, to the exclusion of fostering competition and innovation for the benefit of the consumer.The federal government's recently announced Digital Charter, championed by Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, is a positive first step. While various provincial and federal ministries and regulators are working to address the public's concerns around data, the Digital Charter provides a principles-based framework that will lead, one hopes, to a more cohesive and coordinated regulatory response across the country.The discussions occurring around the concept of open banking, under review by the Department of Finance and currently being repositioned as \"consumerdirected banking,\" is a telling example of why the Digital Charter matters.It is estimated that 3.5 million Canadians are currently hacking their way to gather their own financial data through a practice called \"screen scraping\" via thirdparty service providers. Consumers engage with these services so they can get a holistic view of their personal finances across the multiple institutions they deal with. This helps consumers better understand opportunities for saving and budgeting, and get transparency around fees and products that can help them to do both better.While almost all are in agreement that the practice of screen scraping needs to be replaced with safer and more secure means of data sharing, how this comes to be is the critical question.When consumers and businesses can obtain real and immediate value from the data they generate and access new products and services that will emerge as a result, it will take control out of the hands of the large data holders - which in Canada are the banks. Canada must move to a place where consumers, leveraging their own data, are ultimately in control.Most incumbents argue for a marketplace solution with little regulatory oversight. We believe leaving that in the hands of those who have the most to lose from open banking will lead to a poor outcome for both innovative entrepreneurs and Canadian consumers. The delay in the implementation of payment system modernization is an example of the risk of a marketplace solution.Striking the right balance between consumer protection and supporting innovation and competition is critical. It speaks of levelling the playing field and of transparency, portability and interoperability - essential principles to ensuring that innovative companies can create new products and services without having to overcome what is today an insurmountable data advantage of the incumbents.The Digital Charter is an important starting point for all levels of government, regulators and industry to create a cohesive and sensible regime that ensures we preserve the trust of Canadians and earn the licence to create new products and services that allow them to leverage their own personal data for their own benefit.The \"new gold\" of data has the ability to lead to incredible innovation, competition and empowerment. But if our data are only held and accessible by a few evergrowing data monopolies for solely their benefit, we will continue on a path leading to further public outrage, a risk of regulatory overreach and incumbents falling further behind as they are not forced to compete on a level playing field.

The sweep involved 25 privacy authorities. It looked at 314 connected devices - often collectively referred to as the \"Internet of Things\" - and how they communicate their privacy practices.Canada's focus was on 21 health and wellness devices that are popular among Canadians, including fitness trackers, smart watches, smart scales and bloodpressure monitors.They found that connected devices \"fail to inform users about exactly what personal information is being collected and how it will be used\" - including sensitive data such as health and financial information.The OPC says that the concept of \"the body as information\" is a major focus, as health, genetic and biometric information is being tracked more than ever.During the sweep, staff used connected products and analyzed what information those devices asked for - and what privacy collection and protection information they provided to users.Nearly half of Canadian \"sweepers\" - OPC staff who tested the devices - and more than three-quarters of international sweepers were unable to find basic instructions on how to delete their data once they had begun using the devices.The Global Privacy Enforcement Network, now in its fourth year, is a joint effort among privacy organizations in many countries, including the United States, Britain , members of the European Union and China, and has conducted such privacy sweeps before. By acting in concert, the group is attempting to add global heft to major privacy concerns.Last year, for example, the network conducted another sweep that showed how websites and mobile applications targeted to kids often do not do enough to protect children's privacy.Among the devices that the OPC analyzed in this sweep, it highlighted concerns about a bloodpressure monitor and a thermometer that both asked to track users' locations, without giving adequate explanations about why that was necessary for the device's purposes.Another concern was the Jawbone UP3, which tracks a user's activity, sleep and heart rate. The OPC noted that the device provided an easy online form to request that the company delete all personal information on its servers, including data shared with partners. But the \"sweeper\" found his account was still active, with personal information intact, two months later .Both the Fitbit and Garmin Vivosmart HR fitness trackers were highlighted by the OPC for being too vague in their privacy policies about safeguards they put in place to protect users' data.In another case, the iMazeFitness heart rate strap had a placeholder on its personal information page that said \"[Insert customer data privacy clause here if applicable.]\" \"Many of the privacy communications were generic or vague, or had privacy policies that weren't specific to the devices being evaluated,\" said Brent Homan, the OPC's director-general of PIPEDA investigations. (PIPEDA stands for the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, which is the law in Canada concerning privacy and personal data.)\"Providing information about what is being collected at key points - such as registration or purchase - is a best practice ... rather than having it buried in privacy policies,\" Mr. Homan said.Not only should devices make clear what types of data are being collected and shared, Mr. Homan said, they should make it easier for users to exercise control over that information. Further, where information gathering is not essential to the device's purposes, user consent should be explicit - and the default setting should be not to gather that information, he said."}, "SMH_3438": {"true_label": "10", "text": "The secret world of BLACK OPS The coal spies have put a spotlight on undercover surveillance methods, writes Tom Allard.Burly and bearded, Tony Groves arrived at the camp at Maules Creek in northern NSW, declaring a passion for the environment and an exotic, hidden past.The former military intelligence officer and Harley Davidson enthusiast called himself Tony Allen, and fitted in at first with the ragtag community of greenies and landowners who had been protesting for three years against the dramatic expansion of coal mining in the area by Japanese mining giant Idemitsu and Whitehaven Coal.It soon became apparent that something was odd. He would disappear suddenly and frequently and suggest protest actions that were highly risky and potentially damaging to the cause. Somewhat implausibly, Tony had explained he was facing weapons charges, a fugitive from a bikie gang which he had left amid threats of retribution.\"He was just completely neurotic about being in a photograph,\" says Ben Solity, one of the protest leaders.A Fairfax Media investigation this week uncovered the fact Groves was part of an extraordinary undercover operation against the activists who are known as the Leard Forest Alliance or Front Line Action Against Coal.For five months, former military and intelligence personnel took on assumed identities with elaborate backstories and rotated through the camp, taking notes, reporting back on any planned actions, profiling the leadership and trying to uncover whether the protesters themselves had spies inside the mines.It failed. Several agents were identified, and at least one directly confronted.Groves was a senior figure. His company - the Centre of Intelligence and Risk Management (CIRM) - wrangled the spies for the clandestine operation. He reported to Tyrone Clark, a former Australian Federal Police officer, whose company C5 Management Solutions received the intelligence, distilling it and passed it on to the mining companies via their security arms.Following Fairfax's first report on the espionage on Monday, Idemitsu admitted it had contracted C5 Management Solutions and another firm understood to be involved, the mysterious Strongs Security Services. After years of suspicions among activists, it is the first time that such an operation has been verified.These kinds of \"black ops\" may seem like something from a modern spy novel or a Hollywood blockbuster but have been long documented overseas and speculated about here.And the exposure of the clandestine project raises important and uncomfortable questions about corporate power, privacy and the right to protest.Such outright deception is widespread among a plethora of private security firms, intelligence firms and detective agencies.It is almost certain there have been attempts to infiltrate protest groups and NGOs, but the practice of deception and false identities extends to other private investigation work, including spying on workplaces, people in legal disputes and even divorce.Using a false identity to obtain information on a \"target\" is known as \"pretexting\", says Wayne Edwards, a 31-year surveillance veteran who runs Harjan Investigations.\"It's something that's commonly used within the industry,\" he said.Mr Edwards describes an industry where regulation is weak and often flouted, and where \"manipulation, intimidation and bullying are rife\". It is a sector where big companies dominate and subcontract work to smaller firms.\"You're only as good as your last job and subcontractors are put under pressure by some companies to step outside the boundaries of the code of practice - including things like pretexting - to get results.\"New entrants to the industry are coming from the ranks of former soldiers, police and spies who took up lucrative private contracting work in Iraq and Afghanistan. People like Tony Groves, who worked for the international security giant Garda Global. With the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq winding down, work is more scarce and techniques used in the conflict zones are being deployed in Australia.Companies like C5, CIRM and Strongs Security Services operate in the shadows. All refused to respond to calls from Fairfax Media and only C5 publicly lists its contact information.Their corporate paymasters adopt a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that borders on laughable.Asked about the security operation, Idemitsu's chief operating officer, Rod Bridges, said: \"How they found out all this information [about the protesters' activities] ... Well we didn't ask questions.\" Mr Bridges said he had little knowledge about Strongs Security despite the lucrative contract it was awarded about six months ago, although he believed it was headed by an \"ex-French foreign legionnaire\".Whitehaven Coal - already facing a public relations disaster as its former owner Nathan Tinkler is accused of illegal political donations during Independent Commission against Corruption hearings - insists it had no knowledge or involvement in the exercise.But multiple sources indicate that its security staff, at least, were aware of the infiltration project and benefited from the information it uncovered.\"The protest at Maules Creek has been non-violent and open,\" wrote Phil Laird, a local farmer whose family has been in the district for 160 years. \"If the coal industry wants to know our plans, then perhaps they could engage with the protectors rather than send in undercover security agents to ingratiate themselves around the campfires.\"The activists' aim is to draw attention to the impact of Australia's $60 billion-a-year coal industry on climate change, build popular support to halt its expansion and eventually end it.\"It is an industry with rapidly diminishing social license and, in fact, only last week AMP Capital banned coal from its responsible range of investments, joining the likes of armaments, gambling and pornography,\" Solity says.The companies retort that coal underpins economic prosperity and drastic security measures are required. It's a workplace safety issue, they say, as the protesters trespass on the mining site, threaten to sabotage equipment and thwart building works.But there's something bigger at stake. It's no coincidence that the spying campaign at Maules Creek began as both Idemitsu and Whitehaven began construction of their new mines.The exposure of the black ops at Maules Creek and Boggabri inevitably raises questions about any role of government intelligence and law enforcement agencies.ASIO, the AFP and NSW police all denied they had engaged private firms to infiltrate activist networks, although they do use them to monitor \"open source\" material such as internet sites and social media.As for deploying their own undercover officers to observe protesters, the situation becomes murkier.ASIO director general David Irvine said the domestic spy organisation \"does not limit, or seek to limit, the right of persons to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent\".But in campaigns of civil disobedience, laws are often broken. Hundreds of protesters at Maules Creek have been arrested for offences such as trespass.Does that mean protests like this qualify as \"unlawful\" and therefore a legitimate target of scrutiny for ASIO or the AFP?It seems it very well might, especially if it involves \"energy security\", according to a letter written by then attorney-general Robert McClelland to his colleague, resources minister Martin Ferguson, in 2009.\"While I recognise the right to protest, when actions jeopardise energy security and the delivery of essential services, it is important that measures are taken to prevent and deter unlawful activity,\" McClelland says.ASIO, he tells Ferguson, does monitor protest activity and provides intelligence reporting when there is \"actual, or potential, for violence\".The AFP, he writes, \"continually monitors the activities of issues-motivated groups and individuals who may target establishments through direct action.\"Whether commercially funded or government endorsed, few doubt that the level of surveillance of activists, NGOs and whistleblowers has been as high, or more intrusive."}, "SMH_1216": {"true_label": "11", "text": "ACT could lead way on privacy litigation ACT could lead wayon privacy litigationBy Noel TowellFIRST: SimonCorbell's plan could see Canberrans sue for privacy breaches.The ACT could become the only Australian jurisdiction in which citizens can sue for breach of privacy.Attorney-General Simon Corbell will announce today that if re-elected, ACT Labor will explore making a serious breach of privacy a ''statutory cause of action'', allowing people to pursue compensation payments through the courts.The federal government is concerned about technologies like smart phones which allow images, sounds and other information to be recorded, stored and uploaded on to social media websites, posted on the internet, or distributed by email or instant messaging. The Commonwealth has published an issues paper on the problem, but Mr Corbell's proposal would be the first time an Australian jurisdiction has offered ''civil remedies'' for invasions of privacy.While criminal laws already deal with the most serious invasion of privacy behaviour, there is no right to sue through the civil courts anywhere in Australia, The territory's Human Rights Act provides the right to privacy but it is not legally enforceable and the public sector is covered by the Commonwealth's Privacy Act.''The protection of privacy is also an element of ACT Labor's commitment to the progressive realisation of human rights in the ACT,'' Mr Corbell said. ''ACT Labor believes it would be desirable to look at introducing a statutory cause of action for privacy, something not yet covered in Australian jurisdictions. A statutory cause of action to protect against serious invasions of privacy would provide an additional remedy for breaches of privacy and would be a practical additional mechanism for the protection and promotion of privacy in the ACT.

I mean, isn't he adorable? To post or not to post - that is the conundrum.Back-to-school is the perfect time to talk about setting privacy boundaries for techobsessed kids, but what about their social media-maven parents?In the past decade, a generation of parenting bloggers has grappled with the question of how much online informationsharing about their kids - both the details of their daily lives and how they look in those moments - is too much. How much of their lives belong to parents to share? And more, are kids entitled to a piece of the profits when their cute-as-heck mug is used to hock a brand-building parent's lifestyle?Take the role kids play on the streetstylish blog and Instagram feed of FashionKids.nu, which invites parents to submit \"authorized\" photographs of their coolly dressed children. One presumes that part of the appeal for parents (and presumably agents) is gaining access to FashionKids' 3.3 million followers in order to drive traffic to their own lucrative mini-mes and lifestyle brands.There, anyone can follow threeyear- old Rylee on the feed of her mother, Kelli Murray, who owns the clothing line Rylee and Cru. Or Vancouver's winsome @JeTaimeKyan (age three, 16,000-plus followers). Kyan plugs sippy cups and pacifier clips for his stylish mom's account and is also part of a campaign for unisex kids clothing line Whistle &amp; Flute, a nice line that's made in Victoria, B.C., and run by couple Ryan McCullagh and Miranda Crane, whose own kids, Archer and Aki, sometimes appear on their Instagram feed.Then there's Nashville-based blogger James Kicinski-McCoy (@bleubird), a strategic marketing and branding specialist and cofounder of the online magazine Mother. Independent blogging was an aside that turned into a full-time career before her fi rst child was born, and now it's an explicitly for-profi t endeavour with various components, including a shop. Her kids appear regularly in her Instagram feed, a quarter of a million followers strong (as do cat Bijou and bunny Bubble), so by the nature of the beast, brand collaborations necessarily involve stylized depictions of her family life, through sponsored posts or original content.When stumbling upon a cute toddler (with dimples, especially), it's almost hard not to make a Gerber Baby joke, noting how easy it would be to capitalize on those dimples. Because who wouldn't want to see that face on a box of cereal, right? But what about when it's a kid whose mother is a lifestyle brand? It gets thornier as social channels increasingly become de facto advertorial spaces.The owners of these accounts may be well-intentioned, but the childperformer business, if we dared to call it what it is, doesn't run on good faith. Just ask Hollywood.Despite a century's head start, the entertainment industry hasn't done a great job of protecting its minors. But it did help to crystallize the issue and implement some basic reforms to the lax child labour laws during the golden age of Hollywood, thanks to Jackie Coogan. The juvenile vaudevillian was in Charlie Chaplin's The Kid in 1921, starred in Tom Sawyer and other kid-centric fi lms and went on to play Uncle Fester in the original Addams Family television series. But by the time he was an adult in the 1930s, his mother and stepfather had already squandered some $4-million of his earnings, so he took them to court (he only recovered a fraction of the funds). At the time, his mother said, \"No promises were ever made to give Jackie anything.\"That set the precedent for the California Child Actor's Bill (a.k.a. the Coogan Act) of 1939 (and around the same time, the similar American Humane Society measures that began the \"No Animals Were Harmed\" disclaimer for animal performers like Flipper, Lassie and Rin Tin Tin). It made earnings subject to the Coogan Act, stipulating that a mandatory percentage (anywhere from 30 per cent and up) must be deposited into a blocked trust account. In Canada, a minor's trust is also required (Bill 71 in Canada protects child performers).The children who appear in GOOP-y lifestyle marketing, however, aren't yet considered professional performers. That's the loophole - so-called amateur status. Wherever kids posing or acting is involved and money is changing hands, shouldn't there be some oversight? Reality TV offers a reasonable parallel to the content genres that are hard to classify. One argument suggests that reality TV is documentary-style programming and doesn't necessitate a work permit because the child involved is a participant, not an employee. It's a divisive topic in the entertainment industry, however, because a number of states have no child labour laws in place that cover reality TV.(The state of Georgia, where Honey Boo Boo was fi lmed, doesn't even require trust accounts for child stars; and that show earned the family a reported $20,000 per episode.) Paul Petersen (the original Mouseketeer who played Jeff on The Donna Reed Show) has been working for reform to and education about the issue through the non-profit foundation A Minor Consideration since 1991. We've all raised an eyebrow about the kids in Dance Moms. And there's even worse, red-fl ag stuff like Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8's potty-training episode. (According to an e-mail exchange the Duggars had with A Minor Consideration, Jon and Kate didn't consider kids appearing on a reality show about their family to be work.)What does this have to do with the stage parents of Instagram? Everything. When showcasing one's kids as a marketing extension, whether it's documenting them reality-style or actually dressing and posing them like catalogue models (and with all the improbable gloss of Vine and Instagram prep), there's a fi ne line between parental pride and potential exploitation. It's yet more proof that social media is a wild west - nobody knows how to classify it, let alone govern it.\"What's the harm?\" is the wellintentioned, GOOP-loving parental reply. Whether it's a cute line of children's hats or a site promoting healthy family meals, you could argue that if it's a child who's doing the marketing that triggers profits for the family business, they're entitled to a share of those profits. They're undeniably working, or their image is. Not to be sinister, but this is something no one's talking about. To my mind, if it's a photo that contributes to the bottom line, it's all the same whether it's seen on Vine by a few thousand people or a reality show watched by millions.As for how to introduce reasonable protections, looking to the fashion world is a good place to start: In 2013, the New York legislature approved laws put forth by groups such as Model Alliance and widened protective measures: Print and runway fashion models - classifi ed as those who render creative or artistic services - who are below the age of 18 are now subject to the same labour laws that cover child dancers. They're now classified as child performers, and laws govern the hours they can work and require that trust accounts be created to protect a portion of their earnings. The distinction between an amateur performance that generates income by accidentally becoming a YouTube sensation and tapping the creative, artistic modelling services of a ridiculously cute toddler to further Mom and Dad's social brand ambitions hardly seems any shade of grey to me."}, "TDP_306": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Otaki firm goes global to foil cyber-criminals STARTING as a one-man-band in Otaki Gorge, cyber-crime specialist Andy Prow's software security business has expanded around the world in the fight against cyber criminals, hackers and disgruntled IT workers.Armed with a science degree in computer science and software, Prow launched a software development business in 2001.A decade later, Aura Information Security's customers include the New Zealand Defence Force, customs, the TAB, Xero and Trade Me.Last year it was named by Deloitte as one of the fastest-growing companies in New Zealand, and one of the fastest-growing technology companies in Asia Pacific.Specialising in cyber security since 2006, Aura now has more than 100 customers in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.When he first launched his business, helping people design and build computer systems, Prow noticed a growing need for people to do it securely and a growing lack of skill required to achieve that.\"There was a growing recognition that the web was becoming more used by businesses, the information was becoming far more business critical and people could not afford for their systems to go down.\"Yet people, particularly in New Zealand, were still very unaware of a lot of issues. Bigger organisations like banks knew what to do but there was this massive divide between them and people doing business using ordinary systems with very little understanding of security,\" he said.In 2006 Prow decided to focus exclusively on security space.\"There is a growing need for privacy. More people are putting more information about themselves online - Facebook and other profiles -- but on the flipside we are becoming far more conscious that we only want our personal information given out if we give it, and we do not want it stolen.\"There is a massive push for privacy but also a bigger push for businesses to interact with customers. It is critical their systems stay up,\" Prow said.Citing a recent example, a hairdressing salon management system development company, which had software for hairdressing salons, was selling to the UK where salons had personal privacy issues.\"They had to get their system fully security-reviewed because they did not want people's personal mobile numbers getting out to the press.\"Hairdressers are now starting to worry about IT security, it is a crazy market,\" he said.Basing the business in Otaki Gorge was a lifestyle choice, but he now has 16 staff, predominantly in Wellington, Kapiti and Auckland, while some were mobile.With a completely online business, he had met very few of his customers in person, including Gwana Gold goldmine in Africa.

Ed Markey, D-Mass., said his proposed legislation would increase transparency about the collection of such data and \"update the Fourth Amendment for the 21st-century wireless world.\"Markey's proposal followed the release of detailed reports from each of the nation's biggest wireless carriers saying they received more than 1 million requests for cellphone data from law enforcement in 2011 and again in 2012.In a related story Monday, USA TODAY reported that dozens of local and state police agencies are capturing information about thousands of wireless users at a time, whether they are targets of an investigation or not, according to public records.Many police agencies, responding to inquiries from USA TODAY and Gannett journalists about their use of cellphone data, said access to identity, location and call logs is an important crime-fighting tool. But some privacy advocates and lawmakers expressed concern about checks and balances and about what happens to data from cellphone users who are not police targets.In their response to Markey, the wireless companies said they received about 9,000 requests for cell \"tower dumps\" from local, state or federal law enforcement agencies in 2012. Those tower dumps show police which cellphones connected to a particular tower over a defined span of time.U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said he and colleagues also have been working on these issues, proposing an array of legislation requiring probable cause prior to the release of cellphone records. They also, however, have raised concerns about criminals, businesses and other people or entities being able to access private records via cellphones.\"This is not just about law enforcement,\" Chaffetz said.Markey's proposed legislation would require law enforcement to get a search warrant, and show probable cause, to get cellphone location data or cellphone data in bulk, as they do using tactics such as a cell tower dump.Additionally, Markey said the legislation would require regular disclosures from law enforcement agencies about the nature and volume of their cellphone data requests and require the Federal Communications Commission to set rules about how long wireless carriers can keep customers' personal information. Currently, the wireless carriers have varying policies and all will provide the stored data to police if legally requested.In emergencies, such as searching for a missing person, Markey says his legislation would require police to later submit a \"signed, sworn statement\" from the law enforcement agency documenting why they needed emergency access to the data.Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said generally those are among measures that his organization would like to see passed.\"We want to create appropriate rules so that the police can do their jobs, but do it without trampling over constitutional rights,\" Calabrese said.

It is the frontier of social science - experiments on people who may never even know they are subjects of study, let alone explicitly consent.''This is a new era,'' said Jeffrey T. Hancock, a Cornell University professor of communication and information science. ''I liken it a little bit to when chemistry got the microscope.''But the new era has brought some controversy with it. Professor Hancock was a co-author of the Facebook study in which the social network quietly manipulated the news feeds of nearly 700,000 people to learn how the changes affected their emotions. When the research was published in June, the outrage was immediate.Now Professor Hancock and other university and corporate researchers are grappling with how to create ethical guidelines for this kind of research. In his first interview since the Facebook study was made public, Professor Hancock said he would help develop such guidelines by leading a series of discussions among academics, corporate researchers and United States government agencies like the National Science Foundation. ''As part of moving forward on this, we've got to engage,'' he said. ''This is a giant societal conversation that needs to take place.''Scholars from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford are planning panels and conferences on the topic, and several academic journals are working on special issues devoted to ethics. Microsoft Research, a quasi-independent arm of the software company, is a prominent voice in the conversation. It hosted a panel last month on the Facebook research with Professor Hancock and is offering a software tool to scholars to help them quickly survey consumers about the ethics of a project in its early stages.Although the United States Federal Trade Commission, which regulates companies on issues like privacy and fair treatment of Internet users, declined to comment specifically on the Facebook study, the broader issues touch on principles important to the agency's chairwoman, Edith Ramirez.''Consumers should be in the driver's seat when it comes to their data,'' Ms. Ramirez said in an interview. ''They don't want to be left in the dark and they don't want to be surprised at how it's used.''Facebook, which has apologized for its experiment, declined to comment further, except to say, ''We're talking with academics and industry about how to improve our research process.''Much of the research done by the Internet companies is in-house and aimed at product adjustments, like whether people prefer news articles or cat videos in their Facebook feeds or how to make Google's search results more accurate. But bigger social questions are studied as well, often in partnership with academic institutions, and scientists are eager to conduct even more ambitious research.The Facebook emotion experiment was in that vein. The brainchild of a company data scientist, Adam D.I. Kramer, but shaped and analyzed with help from Professor Hancock and another academic researcher, Jamie E. Guillory, it was intended to shed light on how emotions spread through large populations. Facebook deliberately changed the number of positive and negative posts in the subjects' news feeds over a week in January 2012, then looked at how the changes affected the emotional tone of the users' subsequent Facebook posts.In another well-known experiment, Facebook sent voting reminders to 61 million American users on Election Day in 2010. Some users also saw a list of their friends who said they had already voted, and the researchers found that the specific social nudge prompted more of those people to go to the polls. The study prompted some to suggest that Facebook had the power to sway election results.More recently, the dating site OkCupid conducted experiments on its users, including one in which it hid profile text to see how it affected personality ratings and another in which it told some daters they were a better or worse potential match with someone than the company's software actually determined.Such testing raises fundamental questions. What types of experiments are so intrusive that they need prior consent or prompt disclosure after the fact?How do companies make sure that customers have a clear understanding of how their personal information might be used? Who even decides what the rules should be?Existing United States government rules governing research on human subjects, intended for medical research, generally require consent from those studied unless the potential for harm is minimal. But many social science scholars say the federal rules never contemplated large-scale research on Internet users and provide inadequate guidance for it.For Internet projects conducted by university researchers, institutional review boards can be helpful in vetting projects. However, corporate researchers like those at Facebook don't face such formal reviews.Sinan Aral, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management who has conducted large-scale social experiments with several tech companies, said any new rules must be carefully formulated. ''We need to understand how to think about these rules without chilling the research that has the promise of moving us miles and miles ahead of where we are today in understanding human populations,'' he said. Professor Aral is planning a panel discussion on ethics at a M.I.T. conference on digital experimentation in October. (The professor also does some data analysis for The New York Times Company.)Mary L. Gray, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research and associate professor at Indiana University's Media School, who has worked extensively on ethics in social science, said that too often, researchers conducting digital experiments work in isolation with little outside guidance.She and others at Microsoft Research spent the last two years setting up an ethics advisory committee and training program for researchers in the company's labs who are working with human subjects. She is now working with Professor Hancock to bring such thinking to the broader research world.''If everyone knew the right thing to do, we would never have anyone hurt,'' she said. ''We really don't have a place where we can have these conversations.''Dr. Gray advocates a simple litmus test for researchers: If you're afraid to ask your subjects for their permission to conduct the research, there's probably a deeper ethical issue that must be considered.For Professor Hancock, solutions could include an opt-in process for projects that involve big changes in an Internet user's experience, and a debriefing system to inform users about smaller tests after the fact.Companies will not willingly participate in anything that limits their ability to innovate quickly, he said, so any process has to be ''effective, lightweight, quick and accountable.''While some would say the risks of the Facebook study were obvious, Professor Hancock said the researchers did not realize that manipulating the news feed, even modestly, would make some people feel violated.He learned otherwise from hundreds of anguished and angry emails he received after the work was published. ''They said: 'You can't mess with my emotions. It's like messing with me. It's mind control.'''"}, "TDP_2181": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Tape exposes negotiations A newly leaked conversation between National Party leader Simon Bridges, Paula Bennett and embattled MP Jami-Lee Ross, shows the trio apparently discussing how to present Ross' medical leave at the height of speculation the party had a leaker in its midst.The recording, said to have been made before Bridges announced Ross was going on personal leave, reveals a discussion around how to handle the details of the announcement and negotiate Ross' quiet exit.The conversation appears to be couched in the context that Ross had been both \"disloyal and disruptive\", as well as facing a number of informal complaints from women, at that time, about various forms of harassment.Deputy leader Bennett is heard offering Ross the choice of having his temporary absence described as either \"medical leave\" or for \"family reasons\".Ross agrees \"medical leave\" is accurate and Bridges gives Ross an assurance he will not \"bad- mouth\" Ross in any capacity if Ross complies with the announcement.The new recording, released to Newshub's AM Show - likely from Ross' camp - does not reveal much additional information about what was being wrangled behind the scenes.However its release is likely to be another destabilising shot across the bow for Bridges' leadership, and hints that there is more to come.Speaking with Stuff, Bridges fired back against claims the Ross announcement was a \"cover-up\", saying he had to protect the privacy of the women, as well as Ross in the context he was dealing with serious mental health issues.\"As leader, I was dealing with a serious, complex matter and it was actually two or three things: inappropriate conduct, disloyal and disruptive behaviour, but also a series of serious health issues,\" he said.He rejected claims the party was protecting Ross at the expense of the women, saying they were \"not being political\" and given the nature of the competing issues of privacy and health, he was \"never going to be in a position where it was appropriate to talk\" in open detail about it.\"That hasn't been the wishes of the women, nor in the interests of Jami-Lee,\" Bridges said.Yesterday, The AM Show played segments from what it said was 18 minutes of a recorded conversation between Bridges, Bennett and Ross.The show appeared to have been given an edited version of the recording that did not contain the start of the tape.Bridges also talks about Ross being \"let off\" in the recording, apparently alluding to some of the complaints about Ross' conduct.In segments of the recording played on the show, Bennett says: \"We are trying to give you the lightest possible way out of this.\"Ross: \"So it would be for medical reasons.\"Bennett: \"If that's what you want. I think either medical or family is your best option.\"Ross: \"Medical's true.\"Bridges: \"Yeah, no that's right ... there's no shame in that.\"Bennett: \"And it means that everyone will back off you too, the media and all that sort of stuff, which I think is important.\"At one point in the recording Bridges says: \"There are downsides for me, letting you off with what you've done, OK, I just want you to understand that.\"But if you take the statement for you, and your behaviour subsequently is good, I will never refer to the matters we've talked about ... again.\"Bridges also reportedly says: \"The truth is Jami-Lee we can get through it, and you can get through it, and you can come out the other side if your attitude after the time-out is good and positive, and you can be promoted again.\"Bridges has confirmed that at the time of the call, four or five women had raised \"matters\"; they weren't formal complaints at that stage although more serious allegations have been made since.The \"disloyal and disruptive\" behaviour was apparently on top of that.While Ross maintains he did not leak Bridges' travel expenses, consultancy firm PwC was partway through an inquiry that would later point the finger at Ross - albeit without conclusive evidence.In the recording, Ross says: \"The stuff around harassing staff, which I reject, that is the worst, and I don't even know what that is.\"Bennett: \"Well you do know what the disloyalty stuff is, and that's been put to you really clearly, and if that was put to caucus that would be enough.\"Bridges has confirmed that a week before the recorded conversation, he'd had a phone call with Ross to put those matters of \"disloyalty and disruptiveness\" to him.Bridges and Bennett spoke to Ross' specialist, before discussing the outcome in that phone call.It's understood that 20 minutes later on October 2, and flanked by his deputy, Bridges announced Ross was taking leave for a few months to deal with personal health issues.Bridges described the reasons for Ross' leave as \"potentially embarrassing\".However, it is now not clear whether he was referring to Ross' health issues or the string of allegations from a number of women.--------------------CAPTION:National Party leader Simon Bridges and his deputy, Paula Bennett, hold a press conference announcing National MP Jami-Lee Ross would be taking leave due to ill health.

These proposed changes arose in the context of a consultation process between government and industry that started last year. Critics complain that the wider public - and privacy values - are being left out of key debates about how 21st-century wiretapping is evolving in Canada.  Parliament's inability to agree on new \"lawful access\" surveillance laws over the past decade is having consequences. Because technology continues to evolve, bureaucrats and police and industry officials are often left to figure out themselves how antiquated laws should apply to emerging technologies.  \"The problem is that it is done outside of the public's eye and the public doesn't have a say in it,\" said Charmaine Borg, the NDP MP who serves as the digital-issues opposition critic.  In an interview, she pointed out how privacy concerns led \"a huge mass of Canadians\" to speak out last year, as the government tried - and failed - to pass Bill C-30, the latest attempt at legislation governing how police should access corporate repositories of telecommunications data.  Ms. Borg said she now fears officials will try to achieve through regulation what they could not push through Parliament. \"For me, it opens up a whole box,\" she said. \"Is C-30 going to come back?\"  On Monday, The Globe and Mail revealed the contents of the Solicitor General's Enforcement Standards (SGES), an accord that, since 1996, has specified the surveillance capabilities that mobile-phone companies are obliged to have ready for police.  While not enshrined in law, this accord is a condition of licensing for the telecom carriers who bid on federally controlled airwaves. Because the government is now preparing to auction off a new patch of spectrum, it has been seeking to update these rules.  The SGES accord specifies just how carriers are to help police intercept voice conversations, SMS texts and geolocation information on mobile phones. Yet it is completely silent on how authorities are to capture Internet data moving through smart-phone Web browsers.  Police can regard such grey areas as glaring holes in surveillance practices. Federal regulators at Industry Canada last year floated a consultation document that said the government wanted to open up mobile-phone surveillance beyond \"circuit-switched voice telephony\" - the old means of moving predominantly voice communications - to more modern protocols.  While Ottawa officials suggested the change was only a matter of updating antiquated language, mobile-phone companies were alarmed. For them, the altered clause could have had the effect of putting them on the hook for capturing all manner of Internet communications - a vastly more difficult proposition than traditional wiretapping.  The industry lobbied against the changes. \"Cost was our primary concern. Not so much the cost, it was in the recovery of costs,\" recalled Marc Choma, spokesman for the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, in a telephone interview. \"Because if such [changes] demanded all kinds of technology to be implemented in your systems in order for the lawful access to take place, that can cost a lot of money.\"  Industry Canada officials point out the government listened to the concerns and made changes. \"Most respondents who commented on this issue disagreed with the proposed changes. ... The CWTA also noted that such changes would be more appropriately made through federal legislation,\" reads a document on the Industry Canada website.  The government says it never actually had designs on vastly expanding surveillance.  In Canada, the SGES standards govern the kinds of phone-tapping that transpires after judges sign off on police or intelligence investigations against \"target\" individuals. This sort of surveillance is fundamentally different than the dragnet surveillance employed by intelligence agencies lately in the news, such as the U.S. National Security Agency's indiscriminate \"warrantless wiretapping\" programs.

Many are even offering them free to get a foothold in schools. That has enabled educators nationwide to experiment with a host of novel ''adaptive learning'' products, like math and foreign language apps that record and analyze students' online activities to personalize their lessons.But the new digital tools have also left school district technology directors scrambling to keep track of which companies are collecting students' information and how they are using it.''A teacher can sign up for anything, without the knowledge of anyone else in the district,'' said Steve Young, the chief technology officer of the Judson Independent School District, a school system with some 23,500 students in San Antonio.Already, some districts have experienced data breaches with software they purchased from vendors; in a few cases, student records have been publicly posted on the Internet. And online security researchers have discovered weaknesses in a couple of dozen popular digital learning services.Some legal scholars contend that the practice of signing up teachers directly, rather than their school districts, skirts federal privacy laws. Administrators like Mr. Young say they want teachers to have free access to the best learning apps. Yet guarding against the potential pitfalls - data breaches, identity theft, unauthorized student profiling - is a herculean endeavor.''It's a huge challenge for big districts,'' Mr. Young said, ''and an even bigger challenge for smaller districts.''These concerns are likely to widen as education technology proliferates. Last year, the market for educational software aimed at prekindergarten through 12th-grade students amounted to nearly $8.4 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2010, according to the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group.Yet, for now at least, each school district, of which there are more than 14,000 in the United States, is confronting these challenges and devising solutions on its own.In the Fairfax County, Va., school district, technology experts have conducted their own security reviews of several hundred digital learning products, and failed a few of the most popular ones. In Houston, one of the largest districts in the country, administrators are testing their own rating system for digital learning products and developing a set of district-approved apps for teachers.And in Raytown, Mo., Melissa Tebbenkamp, the school district's director of instructional technology, vets every app that teachers want to try before allowing it to be used with students. Among other things, she checks to make sure those services do not exploit students' email addresses to push products on them or share students' details with third parties.''We have a problem with sites targeting our teachers and not being responsible with our data,'' Ms. Tebbenkamp said. For school technology directors around the country, she added, ''it is a can of worms.''The new tools are being pushed by a rapidly expanding education technology industry. Some educators, entrepreneurs and philanthropists are particularly enthusiastic about adaptive learning products because they aim to tailor lessons to the individual abilities of each student.''If Suzy is good at long division but has trouble with division by zero, the software will show her more problems about division by zero,'' said Umang Gupta, an entrepreneur who has invested in Front Row Education, an adaptive math start-up, and other educational technology ventures.To get such products into classrooms quickly, many start-ups offer their basic products free to individual teachers but charge for extra features or districtwide use - a ''freemium'' business model.''This is an industry driven by the freemium model, and that's a good thing,'' said Betsy Corcoran, the chief executive of EdSurge, an industry news service and research firm. ''It is giving teachers more of a voice in the tools that they use.''The model makes it easy for teachers to try new products, but it also troubles many school technology directors. By enticing teachers to adopt nascent technologies on their own, they say, companies can bypass established district procedures for reviewing the effectiveness and data security of educational software.Teachers, these experts say, are typically not equipped to vet the data-handling practices of free educational apps that may collect details as diverse as students' names, birth dates, profile photos, voice recordings, homework assignments, quiz scores or grades.''When it comes to privacy and security, it's a little unfair to put the burden on the teacher,'' said Bob Moore, a former school district technology director who now runs his own educational technology consulting firm. Teachers, he added, may also not know whether the apps have been rigorously studied to establish their effectiveness.''If you have a math app that focuses on dividing and multiplying fractions,'' Mr. Moore said, ''you should have some evidence that shows how it actually improves student learning around that particular objective.''In addition, some education privacy law scholars say that the direct-to-teacher marketing model circumvents federal privacy laws.One federal law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, requires school districts to maintain the confidentiality of student records and to keep control of those records, even if administrators outsource certain school functions to vendors.Another federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, allows schools to act in place of parents in allowing online providers to collect personal details from children. But the Federal Trade Commission recommends that schools not delegate that decision to individual teachers.''Companies are soliciting teachers to breach the obligations of schools,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan.To help school administrators evaluate digital education services, the Department of Education recently issued best-practice recommendations for contracts. Last year, the Consortium for School Networking, an association for district technology professionals, introduced a free tool kit with data security questions for schools to ask their online service providers. And on Tuesday, a coalition of several dozen educational groups issued a set of principles for responsible use of student data.But Lenny J. Schad, the chief technology information officer of the Houston Independent School District, said that teachers were using so many different apps, sometimes trying them for no more than a week or even a day, that it was impractical, if not impossible, for districts to track their use.''The teachers have the ability to reach out on a much bigger scale than anything that we could manage,'' Mr. Schad said.Mr. Moore, the education technology consultant, said district officials and technology companies might eventually need to develop national standards for the classroom adoption of learning apps.''There needs to be a better system,'' Mr. Moore said, ''than each school district doing their own vetting.''"}, "AFR_2498": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Data experts raising COVIDSafe app concern;Security The proposed COVID-19 legislation must cover all federal and state agencies to stop any back-door breaches of privacy because of gaps in Australia's patchwork of privacy regulation, according to a group of leading data privacy experts.The group has recommended legislation should ensure an appropriate independent agency has oversight of data the COVIDSafe app generates, including ensuring all state and territory agencies maintain a functional separation of the data from other systems.The data from the app should be defined to include all associated metadata and that it covers the whole chain of data from a citizen's smartphone to a contact tracer in a state health agency.The app data is housed in a national store hosted on Canberra-based servers managed by Amazon's AWS.The determination requires encryption of phone data but the experts said \"electronic derived COVIDSafe app data should be required to be encrypted both in transit and at rest [on the AWS server]. This is particularly important given outsourcing of data warehousing.\"The group of privacy practitioners was convened by UNSW Professor of Practice, Peter Leonard, a data consultant and former lead technology partner at law firm Gilbert + Tobin.The group collaboratively developed their response after the federal government this week launched a contract tracing app called COVIDSafe.

This would reflect a new, more practical approach by European officials to remote computing's role in the broader economy.The recommendations are expected to guide decisions on cloud computing by regulators in the 27 E.U. countries. The sellers of cloud services are hoping the new guidelines will improve their image in Europe, where concerns about privacy and fears that business secrets could be stolen in U.S.-based cloud centers have discouraged sales.According to Gartner, the research firm, European sales of cloud computing trail those in the United States by at least two years, in part because of these concerns.''I am hoping that the recommendations will allow people to take advantage of the technology that is out there in a controlled way,'' said David Gibson, vice president in charge of strategy at Varonis Systems, a seller, based in New York, of cloud software to businesses and institutions. ''Some of the regulations being discussed in Europe are actually pretty progressive and could give the business model a push forward there, as well as in the States.''Cloud computing refers to the delivery of services over the Internet rather than through the use of software. There are various types of services and various types of cloud providers, both public and private. The sales of cloud services are rising about 24 percent each year, according to International Data Corp., or about four times as fast as the rate of technology spending over all.Public cloud services - offered by Amazon.com, Salesforce.com and Savvis, among other companies - amounted to $28 billion worldwide in 2011, I.D.C. says.The North American market accounting for $17.4 billion, or 62 percent, of sales, while Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for about $7 billion, according to I.D.C.Companies using the cloud can save money because they do not have to buy or house servers to deliver the services or store data. Users of the cloud typically submit personal information to gain access to their services and data.European interest in the cloud appears to be increasing, despite the euro currency crisis and economic downturn, industry executives said.Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Bayerische Motoren Werke and Burberry, among other companies, are all using the cloud-based customer relations management services of Salesforce.com, which in May said it had to hire 750 employees in Europe this year to meet demand from its 20,000 clients on the Continent.In June, Amazon Web Services, the cloud services arm of the U.S. online retailer, made a presentation to several hundred potential customers at an IMAX movie theater on Alexanderplatz in Berlin. ''The room was packed, and from what I can tell, the interest in cloud computing is growing,'' said Andy Jassy, the Amazon Web Services vice president in charge of the division, who made the presentation. ''In difficult economic times, more companies are looking to the cloud to save money.''Some governments in Europe are also beginning to use cloud services to cut costs. The borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in England is a customer of Salesforce.com. In Belgium, the national government is creating its own cloud to consolidate government services, said Georges Ataya, a professor of information technology management at Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. European national governments - which are typically required by law to process personal data within their own borders - are either buying domestic cloud services or setting up their own private clouds to cut technology costs, Mr. Ataya said.''I think, over time, there is no question that cloud services are going to take hold in Europe as they have in the United States,'' Mr. Ataya said.The guidelines are unlikely to harmonize in a significant way the patchwork of national privacy laws that govern cloud computing in Europe, which has tended to reduce the appeal of remote computing services on the Continent.Britain and Scandinavian countries tend to be more permissive than other European nations about the ways personal data can be processed in clouds, whereas Spain and France impose tough requirements, like requiring cloud service sellers to know at all times where information is being kept, said J\u00f6rg-Alexander Paul, a privacy lawyer at the firm Bird &amp; Bird in Frankfurt. Germany has strict laws on handling cloud data, Mr. Paul said, but its enforcement is relatively lax.The guidelines expected to be introduced Monday are nonbinding. Regulators in E.U. countries are required to give them ''utmost consideration'' in drafting national policies, but have the discretion to interpret the guidelines as they see fit.Still, the guidelines are likely to influence many E.U. nations in their treatment of cloud computing and privacy, particularly the recommendation that regulators accept third-party audits paid for by cloud service companies as proof that personal information is being handled, even in non-E.U. countries, under E.U. privacy laws. Previously, some E.U. regulators had been reluctant to accept the audits.While the report gives greater support to cloud computing than ever before, the list of recommendations - about 30 pages long - from the panel, which is made up of the Union's 27 national privacy regulators, also attempts to establish privacy requirements for cloud service sellers that could make remote computing more expensive in Europe.One recommendation would require a cloud services seller to inform clients exactly where their data are being physically stored at any time of day. Another would require sellers to delete all personal data in cloud computing centers when retaining the data is no longer necessary. A third may compel cloud service companies to disclose to clients the subcontractors they plan to use to process data.The first two requirements, while perhaps providing greater security to European cloud users, could also add complexity and cost to managing data in clouds. The third recommendation, if aggressively enforced by E.U. regulators, could undermine large sellers of cloud services by disclosing to clients a list of potential lower-cost rivals. Some sellers, like Microsoft, have already published a list of 100 subcontractors the company uses to provide cloud services under the Microsoft brand.For transfers of European data to the United States, the report advises European cloud service customers to demand the data protection safeguards of the so-called European model contract, a legal agreement that imposes regular reporting and auditing requirements on cloud operators to prove that data are being handled according to E.U. law. The model contract would supplement the Safe Harbor Agreement, a 12-year-old pact between the United States and European Union that has set out mutual privacy standards for data storage and transfers.Some European regulators view enforcement of Safe Harbor guarantees, which are overseen by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as insufficient.Some analysts were not convinced that the recommendations will overcome lingering unease of European companies reluctant to store data in U.S.-based clouds, where sensitive information about customers or business practices can theoretically be subject to government surveillance under the Patriot Act.''There is a fair amount of misunderstanding and downright mistrust of the Patriot Act amongst E.U. customers,'' said Chenxi Wang, an analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco. ''A lot of that is emotional reaction versus sound legal judgments.''"}, "DT_3863": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Who's writing my emails?;Patrick Flanery's story of surveillance leaves Lucy Daniel wanting more 'We should all assume someone may be watching, Jeremy, even though we cannot know for certain if or when they are definitely watching. We have made the world a virtual panopticon.\" So speaks an Egyptian scholar near the end of I Am No One, Patrick Flanery's disquieting new novel about surveillance.The panopticon, Jeremy Bentham's 18th-century design for a prison in which all inmates could be observed at all times, has become a popular metaphor for the internet and an age which, as Flanery's novel takes for granted, has reached \"the end of privacy\".The narrator, another Jeremy, is a fiftysomething American academic who has spent the past decade teaching at Oxford and has recently returned to New York City to strengthen ties with his daughter, who has married a young media tycoon. The glassedin comfort, \"barring revolution\", of his daughter's life is a safety bubble. Jeremy, however, is a sitting duck for all kinds of unwarranted intrusions.First, someone hacks his email account, unaccountably messing with his appointments. Then he receives a package containing a printout of all his internet activity. He keeps bumping into the same obnoxious stranger and acquires a stalker. But what kind of surveillor is this, so keen to let him know he is being watched? The reasons unravel, as Jeremy remembers a relationship with a former student.Jeremy is a historian with an interest in the Stasi, also lecturing on films about surveillance and art made from CCTV images. He appreciates more than most how the everyday is altered by burglar alarms, mobile phones, drones and satellites. Early on, he mentions in an eerily offhand manner that a Syrian student made threats against him in his early days at Oxford: \"I reported the young man to the terrorist hotline that Britain had then set up and within a few days he disappeared and no more was ever heard of him.\"As the packages continue to arrive, Jeremy becomes paranoid. Confronted with emails sent from his account that he has no memory of writing, he wonders whether the person sending the papers could really be a previous version of himself. He asks: can I \"know what I am beneath the conscious fiction I present to others as well as myself \"? Flanery is the author of two previous novels, Absolution, set in a turbulent South Africa, and The Fallen Land, set against the boom and bust of the US housing market. Both are weighty, but readable, stories that touch on intrusions of privacy. I Am No One is also compelling, yet one can't help but think that with such a vastly suggestive subject (in \"our post-Snowden world\", as the book jacket puts it), the impact of surveillance on identity, communication and relationships remains oddly under-explored.The narrative voice is fond of subordinate clauses: \"I could see almost at once, however, that Meredith and Peter had been talking and there was something they needed to say, as if they had - this turned out to be the case - made a decision about me in the hours following my confession of the unexplainable lacuna in my memory, or so it then seemed.\" The interminable circumspection, exasperating at times, makes Jeremy an ambiguous figure, as unsure of his own motives as he is of those who watch him. \"I'm no one,\" he tells his daughter. Unfortunately, his everyman potential means that he is not quite individual enough to sustain his narrative's self-obsession.There are some suspenseful moments, but as the novel digresses into romance it seems aware of its shortcomings. \"Campus melodrama or spy thriller. In what genre am I trapped?\" Jeremy wonders. An American alien in the UK, he talks about dislocation from his national identity; but it turns out that he was being disingenuous when he insisted that he had no idea why the National Security Agency or anyone else would want to track him.The most interesting of the novel's ambiguities is that Jeremy is acutely aware of the depressing prospect of ending up unobserved, ignored. By the end of the novel, he finds that living with the permanent possibility of being visible is a fairly modest dystopia when, on the other hand, there might be nobody watching.To order this book from the Telegraph for \u00a310.99 plus \u00a31.99 p&amp;p call 0844 871 1515"}, "NYT_930": {"true_label": "01", "text": "'Do Not Track' Internet dispute gets mediator FULL TEXTOver the past few months, an international effort to give consumers more control over the collection of their online data has devolved into acrimonious discussions, name-calling and witch hunts.The idea was to work out a global standard for ''Do Not Track,'' a computer browser setting that would allow Internet users to signal Web sites, advertising networks and data brokers that they did not want their browsing activities tracked for marketing purposes.But some industry executives involved in the negotiations have questioned the agenda of privacy advocates, saying their efforts threaten to undermine an advertising ecosystem that fuels free online products and services. At the same time, some technology experts and privacy advocates have accused industry executives of stalling and acting in bad faith.Into this rancorous battle steps a new mediator, Peter Swire, a professor of law at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official during the administration of President Bill Clinton. On Wednesday, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, the international consortium that has been trying to develop technical Do Not Track standards, said that Mr. Swire would take over as co-chairman of its Tracking Protection Working Group.While parties on both sides welcomed the move, many said they were doubtful that Mr. Swire could bring opponents to agreement, especially at a time when some industry groups were questioning whether the W3C was the right forum.On one hand, industry executives have an interest in protecting ''behavioral'' ads, marketing pitches that use data about an individual's online activities to tailor ads to that person. On the other hand, consumer advocates argue that Internet users should be able to limit that kind of online surveillance.Mr. Swire, a former chief counselor for privacy at the Office of Management and Budget, said he hoped to strike a balance that was palatable to both sides. He said he viewed a Do Not Track system as a kind of digital equivalent to the Do Not Call list, a national registry in the United States through which consumers may opt out of phone solicitations.''People can choose not to have telemarketers call them during dinner. The simple idea is that users should have a choice over how their Internet browsing works as well,'' Mr. Swire said by telephone. But he added: ''The overarching theme is how to give users choice about their Internet experience while also funding a useful Internet.''Still, Mr. Swire may not be able to overcome the bitterness that remains among the negotiating parties after months of public accusations, personal attacks and recriminations.At an event at the White House this year, industry representatives publicly committed to incorporating and honoring a browser-based Do Not Track system under certain conditions. The conditions included a requirement that individual users would actively choose to turn on a don't-track-me setting. Industry groups also said that systems should still allow companies to collect information about users' browsing activities for market research and product development purposes.But after months of wrangling with consumer advocates, industry representatives now say the W3C is not an appropriate forum for them to work out policy details, arguing that the group's expertise is more technical than practical.In an online discussion forum for the working group, for example, senior industry executives have suggested that respected technology experts are out of touch with commercial reality.''The advocacy side of the group tends to lean toward absolutist terms and solutions,'' Shane Wiley, vice president for privacy and data governance at Yahoo, wrote in a message in September to Edward W. Felten, a professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey. ''The real world isn't that easy even if it feels that way in a classroom or a small lab.''Then there are the technologists who say industry executives are playing down the privacy risks of data mining.''For want of a better metaphor: you are the climate change skeptic of computer privacy,'' Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student in computer science and law at Stanford University, wrote last month to Mr. Wiley of Yahoo. ''Unlike some of the more patient members of the group, I long ago ceased pretending you're negotiating in good faith.''Now the industry has begun an effort to distance itself from the W3C process and promote its own self-regulatory program that allows consumers to decline targeted advertising by installing opt-out buttons from dozens of member companies.''We've seen the W3C falter,'' said Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group. ''So industry is redoubling its efforts to come up with a meaningful standard for browser controls.''As the debate rages on, newer iterations of popular browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Chrome have already installed Do Not Track settings for their users. But in the absence of accepted global standards for these systems, ad networks and data brokers are not yet honoring the don't-track-me browser flags. Even the Microsoft and Google ad services don't respond to such signals coming from their own browsers.Although Mr. Swire said he hoped to spur progress, for the moment Do Not Track browser settings have no more significance than emoticons.''Do Not Track is a work in progress,'' Mr. Swire said.

He'd lurk there till the building closed at night. Possibly he brought a packed lunch and thermos for the long days on voluntary duty.One day, a woman looked up to see him peering down at her over the partition. She screamed, he was caught, and the courts dealt with him. I'm glad I wasn't that woman. It would be like finding a rat in your kitchen. You'd be upset for days.Animals, including us, are cautious about their toileting and like to feel safe and unobserved. You're vulnerable with your pants down, and you're not using the toilet for other people's sexual gratification anyway.

It causes harm.It's baffling that the former top Defence Force man posted in Washington set up recording devices to watch his colleagues use the toilet. Once the gadget was found and traced back to him, public naming and shaming, and the bewilderment of family, who'd never see him in quite the same way again, were inevitable.

In today's mobile culture, social-media and searchengine companies are collecting information bit by bit and building detailed profiles of every person on the planet. Nobody is exempt, not even children and teenagers. Profiles are built not only with information gleaned directly from us, but as we are seeing from the Cambridge Analytica case, information pulled from our friends, family and connections. These profiles then become precious merchandise for sale - money in the bank for companies in the business of selling them.Given Facebook's business model of selling the precise targeting of potential customers, Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data to target voters in the U.S. election is not all that shocking.With the immense amount of data that is being silently collected about us, new questions around regulation and privacy have come to the fore. As with highly regulated sectors such as banking and health care, there is a need to regulate the collection, distribution and use of personal data. As Daniel Therrien, Canada's Privacy Commissioner, said in a statement, \"The digital world, and social media in particular, have become entrenched in our daily lives, and people want their rights to be respected.\"Companies such as Facebook thrive on selling user data, yet there is little governance in terms of how that data is managed, who buys it or how it will be used. We only need to look in our own backyard at Alphabet Inc.'s Sidewalk Labs project, which will turn a portion of Toronto's waterfront into a test bed for \"smart city\" technologies. Those technologies will use data collected from sensor-lined streets to guide everything from street lights to pollution-reduction initiatives to the movement of people, traffic and goods through the area. But the project raises major questions: Where will the data be housed?Who will own it? In what context will it eventually be used?Although data analytics have been used in retail for quite some time to target buyers and influence purchasing decisions, we're now seeing the same technology being used to target voters in the political arena. We are only beginning to understand the damage this technology can inflict if allowed to be used unchecked. Do we really understand what we are disclosing when we sign up to social networks, fill out online surveys, use a mapping app or upload our photographs? There is a severe need for governance of data-driven organizations to protect the basic freedoms and security that our society is built on.New technologies bring the possibility of positive transformations for mankind, but we know from history that technology has also been used to cause great harm. Governments must work with the private sector to ensure that new technology is used for the betterment of humanity."}, "SMH_4990": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Swiss email service won't comply with new laws A Switzerland-based company that offers the world's most popular encrypted email service says it won't have to comply with new national security laws.The refusal exposes a major flaw in the government's push to give new powers to law enforcement agencies to tackle online crime.ProtonMail, which reportedly has more than 5 million users worldwide, also doesn't believe it would have to remove its smartphone apps from Apple and Google's stores in Australia.ProtonMail was used by Cambridge Analytica to cover up correspondence about secretly influencing elections, including the 2016 US presidential race.ProtonMail, based on technology developed at the CERN physics lab in Switzerland, uses its secrecy as a selling point.It claims to be used by \"journalists, dissidents, doctors, lawyers, NGOs and even regular people who rightfully won't want their data sold and resold without their consent\". \"While we may not always agree with the people who use ProtonMail, we must nevertheless continue to protect their privacy rights.\"The service was banned in Turkey earlier this year.On its website it says it believes \"privacy and security are universal values which cross borders\".The company complies with orders from a Swiss court providing information such as account use patterns.

One in 10 confessed they had shared the name of a pet on Instagram while also using it as a password. The bank said celebrities set a bad example by posting intimate details online, such as birthdays and the names of pets, which could be used by fraudsters.American singer Taylor Swift regularly posts on Instagram about her cats; Meredith, Olivia and Benjamin. And Kylie Jenner shares so much about her two dogs, Norman and Bambi, that they now have their own account with almost half a million followers.Earlier this year, soap actor Dean Gaffney, was criticised after revealing his bank details to almost 65,000 Instagram followers, when he posted a picture where the card number and expiry date were clearly visible.A survey of 2,000 people by One Poll, commissioned by Santander, found 40 per cent of under-25s are influenced by what celebrities post online, while 78 per cent do not know how to protect themselves from identity theft. The results come as scam prevention charity CIFAS reports a 26 per cent rise in fraud cases targeting under-21s in 2018.Jodie Cook, a social media expert, said: \"It's worrying to see influential celebrities share so many personal details online.

On Monday, the Toronto Police Service will join the growing ranks of police forces adopting the latest law-enforcement technology when officers head out onto the streets, cameras rolling.By the end of May, 100 Toronto police officers across the city will be wearing the increasingly popular policing tool, part of a nearly year-long pilot project that was a recommendation of the Toronto police's use-of-force review that followed the fatal 2013 police shooting of teenager Sammy Yatim.The small recording device - attached high on the officer's torso, near the lapel - has a big job: to increase public accountability and enhance trust, provide an unbiased account of public interactions, augment officer and public safety, protect police from unwarranted allegations of misconduct and more.\"I feel like it's a very exciting project, I think this has the potential to strengthen the policing profession and I think it has the potential to strengthen our relations with the community,\" said Staff Supt. Tom Russell at a news conference unveiling the cameras Friday.Toronto police are following forces in Vancouver, Edmonton and Ontario cities such as Thunder Bay, Hamilton, London that have already launched pilot projects experimenting with the policing tool.The Calgary Police Service, one of the earliest adopters in Canada, has moved beyond the experimental stage and expanded the number of body cameras used by their officers from 50 in 2013 to 1,100 today.But the lightning-fast expansion of the technology across Canada has also prompted a chorus of concern from privacy groups worried about everything from the tool being used as surveillance to potential privacy breaches inside private residences.Earlier this year, federal and provincial information privacy commissioners issued a set of guidelines for law enforcement agencies, which included a plea for police services to seriously consider whether the technology is even necessary, considering the plethora of privacy concerns.Russell, who is spearheading the body-worn camera project, assures that Toronto police have carefully considered the privacy implications of the cameras, in consultation with Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner.In cases where officers were invited into a private home, for instance, officers will turn off the camera when asked, although the camera stays on during an emergency call inside a home or while police are executing a search warrant.Police will similarly keep the cameras rolling during interactions in public, though citizens will be told they are being recorded as soon as reasonably possible.Each officer is in control of turning the recording device off and on, but Russell says the decision of what and when to record has been clearly spelled in procedures drafted to ensure an officer does not simply record when he or she pleases.Every time an officer responds to a call for service or is investigating an individual during the course of their duties, the cameras are to be activated. The record button is also to be pushed when an officer questions and documents someone not suspected of a crime, a police practice known as \"carding.\" Police officers will not activate their cameras during an informal conversation with a citizen.If an interaction with the public is not recorded when it should have been, the officer may be subject to a discipline process, Russell said.Before heading out onto the streets with the cameras, the officers participating in the pilot received training at Toronto Police College, which included running through real-world scenarios ranging from a domestic-dispute call to an impaired-driving stop to a regular traffic stop. Officers also \"took the stand\" in mock trials using the video.Const. Neil Robinson, with the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) unit, said it may take some time for him and his colleagues to get used to the technology, but in many ways, the bodycams are nothing new.\"Officers like stability, they like the same thing, but overall, it's not going to change too much in how we do things,\" he said. \"When we're in the community and people see us talking to somebody, there's always another 10 people coming out with their cameras and recording us. So this is just another camera.\"Robinson said that having his own recording device is reassuring, since sometimes citizen video of police interactions may not capture the whole thing.The cameras will be out in Toronto until the end of March. The results of the experiment will be presented to the Toronto Police Services Board in June.Body-worn camera FAQsWhen will they be activated?The cameras will always be on standby. The cameras will be activated every time an officer responds to a call for service or is investigating an individual during the course of their duties.Who will be wearing them?One hundred officers from the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) Rapid Response Teams, from Traffic Services, from 55 Division's Primary Response Unit and 43 Division's Community Response Unit. Police said the variety of officers was chosen to ensure the project included a cross-section from the force, and chose cops who regularly interact with the public in a variety of ways.How long will the video footage be stored?The encrypted video will be downloaded at the end of each officer's shift, held on a secure server at Toronto police headquarters, and kept for a minimum of one year. However, if the video is required for an investigation, it will be flagged and stored for longer.How much does the pilot project cost?The project has a budget of $500,000, including cameras, software, docking stations and storage. The pilot project is testing out three different types of cameras - to decide which one works best for the officers - and each camera costs between $600 and $1,000. There is currently no estimate in terms of how much it will cost to have the cameras roll out service-wide.Can I see the video that an officer has made of me?The video footage captured by police will be subject to Freedom of Information legislation, meaning citizens can make a request to access a copy.When can a citizen ask for the camera to be turned off?In a public place, if a citizen asks for the camera to be turned off, the officer will keep recording if the interaction is one he is required to record. In circumstances where a citizen has invited the police into their home but don't want the camera on, officers will turn it off. However, if officers are in a private home in an emergency situation or while conducting a search warrant, the cameras will be left on.Do officers have the ability to alter or delete the video?An officer does not have the ability to delete anything on the camera itself. Police say the camera is secure, the video is encrypted and an officer goes to a docking station and downloads it to a server. The officer does not have the ability to alter, delete or edit the video."}, "NYT_4050": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Online and Making Thousands, at Age 4: Meet the Kidfluencers FULL TEXTSamia was an influencer before she could talk.Her parents, Adam and LaToya Ali, are influencers themselves and began chronicling Samia's impending arrival on YouTube and Instagram in 2014, once Ms. Ali learned she was pregnant. \"Samia's birth video is on YouTube, so she's pretty much been born into social media,\" Mr. Ali said. Samia is now 4 and has 143,000 followers on Instagram and 203,000 subscribers on YouTube. Her feeds are mostly populated with posts of her posing and playing, but they also feature paid promotions for brands like Crayola and HomeStyle Harvest chicken nuggets. There are instances when \"Samia can't verbatim get the message out,\" Mr. Ali, who lives in the Atlanta area, said of the promotional posts. \"Sometimes, their talking points are not kid talk, so LaToya would need to appear, or myself, to relay those because those are key deliverables that the brands want.\" Welcome to the world of kidfluencers. Brands have flocked to influencers - individuals, famous or not, with large followings on social media - for years, hoping their online popularity will prompt their fans to buy the products they vouch for. Then child influencers started appearing on their parents' profiles, a surreal but seemingly harmless offshoot of this phenomenon. Now, advertisers like Walmart, Staples and Mattel are bankrolling lucrative endorsements deals for toddlers and tweens with large followings and their own verified profiles on YouTube and Instagram. As a result, children too young to make their own accounts on the platforms are being turned into tastemakers. Instagram, owned by Facebook, and YouTube, which is part of Google, are designed for adults in large part because of a federal privacy law that protects children under 13. Bios for many of the younger influencers on Instagram note that the pages are \"run by parents,\" and YouTube channels are presumably registered to their guardians.Because they say their platforms are 13-and-older zones, technology companies do not have to comply with federal rules that limit targeted advertising and data collection. But Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said the companies had no incentive to keep children off the sites. And as TV ratings continue to fall and children spend more time online, advertisers are spending more money to reach them there. \"The fact that brands are using actual children as influencers is a very clear sign that they're targeting children that they know are on these platforms,\" Mr. Golin said. That can mean big money for the families of kidfluencers. Kyler Fisher, the father of 2-year-old identical twins who have more than two million followers on Instagram, said a sponsored post on the girls' account could fetch between $10,000 and $20,000. The twins, Taytum and Oakley, have promoted car seats and Carnival Cruise Lines on Instagram. They are also central to the success of their parents' YouTube channel, Kyler &amp;amp; Mad, which has about three million subscribers. Promotions on the family YouTube channel can draw $25,000 to $50,000.Fans are so interested in the family that their third child, due the first week of March, already has 112,000 Instagram followers.  \"My kids complete the package, man,\" Mr. Fisher said. \"If we didn't have the girls, I can't imagine being as far as we are.\"Another parent shared the prices commanded by the parent's child on the condition of anonymity, citing concern that the disclosures could harm negotiations with brands. The parent said brands might pay $10,000 to $15,000 for a promotional Instagram post while a sponsored YouTube video might earn $45,000. A 30- to 90-second shout-out in a longer video can cost advertisers between $15,000 and $25,000. Brands are also pursuing children with smaller followings. The toy company Melissa &amp;amp; Doug emailed parents about a six-week influencer campaign last summer, offering payments and free toys for weekly Instagram posts of their children \"having fun with the toys!\" The company said it would pay $10 per 1,000 followers for individual Instagram posts and $5 per 1,000 followers for Instagram Story posts. The rise of this kind of advertising has raised questions involving fair compensation, oversight and work permits, especially since child labor guidelines vary by state.Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokeswoman, said that the site didn't allow anyone under 13 to make or own accounts and that it worked \"closely with experts, nonprofit organizations and others in our industry to protect families using our services.\" YouTube came under fire last month after lewd comments by pedophiles were discovered on innocent videos of children; the company has since said it will suspend comments on most videos of minors. Some channels that can \"demonstrate a low risk of predatory behavior\" will keep comments but require moderators, the company said. It remains to be seen if disabling comments will hurt the kind of connections kidfluencers try to establish with their fans. Sravanthi Dev, a spokeswoman for Instagram, said that while the platform prohibited users 12 and under, their parents or representatives could create profiles for them \"as long as it is clear in the bio information that the account is run by the parent or representative.\" Michelle Foley's 6-year-old daughter, Ava, and her best friend, Everleigh, also 6, have more than a million followers on their shared Instagram and YouTube accounts. YouTube's analytics say Ava and Everleigh's viewers are largely between the ages of 25 and 44, Ms. Foley said, but she said she thought the core audience was between 8 and 18. \"When we go out, parents never know who we are, but kids do,\" Ms. Foley said. Alex Chavez-Munoz, a founder of Viral Talent, which works with child influencers, also disputed the data.\"When you see the analytics of a kidfluencer channel, the dominant audience is 25- to 34-year-old women,\" Mr. Chavez-Munoz said. \"That's obviously not the case. The case is that the child is watching it on their parents' device.\"In December, a 9-year-old kidfluencer known as Txunamy shared a photo on Instagram and asked her more than two million followers to comment on it and share their ages. Thousands of replies flooded in: 9, 10, 11 years old.Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, found more than 3,100 Instagram influencers, from a sample of 1.2 million accounts, who are likely under 13 based on terms in their bios like \"managed by mom.\" (Instagram has more than a billion users.) Each account had at least 1,000 followers. On YouTube, the much bigger kid influencer destination, there are toy accounts like Ryan ToysReview, whose young star earned $22 million in a year, according to Forbes. But children, under their parents' watch, are also building followings on YouTube and Instagram as gamers, video bloggers, fashionistas, mischievous toddlers and personalities who anchor family channels, which are often a cross between reality TV, pranks and random skits. YouTube accounts can also bring in serious ad dollars without brand deals, which are shared with the site.Everleigh's grandmother, whom Ms. Foley met when they worked together, came up with the idea of making an Instagram account for the girls when they were 10 months old, calling them \"besties\" and dressing them in matching outfits. The girls went \"viral\" eight months later after the account helped them land a modeling campaign for the Kardashian Kids line, Ms. Foley said. At that point, \"we were like, 'We should start a YouTube,' but they couldn't talk,\" she said. \"So then we kind of waited for them to start talking.\"The girls also have their own separate Instagram accounts. Everleigh's sponsored posts have included promotions for toys (\"I'm excited to share that the new PAW Patrol Mighty Pups line is available exclusively at Walmart!\") and Disney dolls (\"Everleigh is in LOVE with her Fancy Nancy dolls!\"). The girls have made celebrities out of the rest of their families. Ava's 1-year-old brother has 148,000 Instagram followers, and Everleigh's newborn sister has a million. Recently, Everleigh started a YouTube channel, Everleigh Opens Toys, and Ava is interested in making one, too, Ms. Foley said.\"If it wasn't for Everleigh and Ava, I would not have what I have today,\" she said. Brands want to team up with children for the same reasons they want to work with older social media personalities  - their follower counts, the ability to post more quickly than traditional ad agencies, the way the posts feel like recommendations from a friend. But advocates say these techniques can deceive children, who are in the early stages of understanding and recognizing advertisements. Children's television, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, has rules that separate ads from content and limit product placement and promotions by a program's host or characters. The internet doesn't. YouTube has its own guidelines for children's advertising, but they are often hard to police. For example, the YouTube Kids app, designed for children 12 and under, is not supposed to contain sponsored content, but The New York Times found several paid advertorial videos from influencers there for companies like Walmart, Dreamworks and Claire's. (YouTube removed the videos after The Times asked about them.)\"It is very manipulative of young children,\" said Kathryn Montgomery, a professor emerita at American University's School of Communications. \"With this form of promotion and advertising, there is a purposeful blurring of those lines.\"Ava and Everleigh's YouTube channel peppers sponsored videos among dance battles and hangouts with other influencers. Ms. Foley said the family could get 10 email requests a day from brands. The girls posted a 10-minute sponsored video for Mattel in November titled \"First Sleepover Opening Giant Presents!\" An adult asked the children, clad in matching pajamas, about their holiday wish list, which was \"Barbie everything!\" They appeared to sleep, then woke up, squealing, to wrapped Barbie merchandise. Mattel declined to comment on its child influencer strategy.In an advertorial video for Staples,  Txunamy declared her excitement about back-to-school shopping at the chain, then showcased her \"haul.\"\"Whenever we work with younger influencers, all contracts and negotiations are conducted through their parents or talent agencies directly representing them,\" said Meghan McCarrick, a spokeswoman for Staples.Social media stars aren't typically considered actors under the law. In California, a portion of child actors' earnings are set aside in a trust based on the decades-old Coogan Law, named for a former child star whose parents spent all his money by the time he turned 21. Similar trusts are required by New York, Louisiana and New Mexico. For kidfluencers, it&amp;#39;s usually a voluntary decision by parents to create these accounts. Several families said they had established the accounts after working on traditional TV shows or national commercials. As for the children, it can be tough for them to understand how much of a fuss they're creating. Samia's father, Mr. Ali, said, \"She doesn't have a concept of viral or 'views,' so it's almost like, for her, walking into an experiment to learn something - it's more of us giving her a task or assignment, where she has something to conquer.\"He added, \"We'll know when she gets a sense of her following and let her know what this all means.\""}, "USA_2000": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Zuckerberg: Regulation of Facebook 'inevitable';But CEO says small start-ups could suffer WASHINGTON \u2013 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that federal regulation of Facebook and other Internet companies is \"inevitable\" \u2014 an acknowledgement that comes as Congress is considering how to respond to a massive privacy breach at the social media giant.\"The Internet is growing in importance around the world in people's lives; I think it's inevitable that there will be some regulation,\" the 33-year-old  told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.However, Zuckerberg cautioned lawmakers to be careful that any legislation they craft does not create regulations that are impossible for small start-up companies to follow. He noted that Facebook, which he created with friends in his college dorm room and launched in 2004, was once one of those start-ups. The company now has 2 billion users around the world.\"I think a lot of times regulation puts in place rules that a large company like ours can easily comply with but that small start-ups can't,\" Zuckerberg said as he testified for the second consecutive day on Capitol Hill.Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the House commerce committee, said he was glad Zuckerberg \"conceded that industry needs to be regulated.\"\"I agree,\" Pallone said. \"It's time for this Congress to pass comprehensive legislation. If all we do is have a hearing and nothing happens, then we haven't accomplished anything.\"Zuckerberg promised Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., that Facebook would work with Congress to develop regulations that prioritize consumers' right to privacy.Zuckerberg faced another long day of testimony on Wednesday as he appeared before the House panel, where he answered questions for five hours. He was also questioned for about five hours Tuesday by a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.In addition to providing information for lawmakers to use to craft legislation, the high-profile hearings provided a chance for members of Congress to garner some attention for themselves. Many of the 55 members of the House panel spent more time making mini speeches Wednesday than giving Zuckerberg a chance to answer their questions.Zuckerberg is trying to restore public confidence after recent revelations that information from up to 87 million Facebook users was shared with Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. The information was shared without users' knowledge.Zuckerberg's promises to do more to protect the privacy of users' data did not appear to satisfy senators, as both Republicans and Democrats said they will consider legislation to create privacy standards that Facebook and other companies must meet. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Tuesday that \"Facebook is a virtual monopoly, and monopolies need to be regulated.\"Zuckerberg said he would not automatically oppose federal regulations as long as they're the \"right regulations.\" He did not specify  what those would be beyond his endorsement of a bipartisan bill -- the Honest Ads Act -- that would require disclosure of who is paying for political ads on Facebook and other social media platforms. Twitter endorsed the bill on Tuesday.Congress has generally been reluctant to impose new regulations on businesses, but they are feeling public pressure to act after major missteps by Facebook on privacy and on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Still, passing any major piece of legislation through Congress is a challenge, especially in an election year.\"Congress does two thing well: We do nothing and we overreact,\" said Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., who opposes government action. \"We're getting ready to overreact.\"Long told Zuckerberg, \"You're the guy to fix this. We're not.\" "}, "GM_4780": {"true_label": "10", "text": "BOOK REVIEW;Capitalism's dangerous digital child;Harvard academic Shoshana Zuboff expands on her 'surveillance capitalism' concept and explores how it's worse than we knew, and the worst is yet to come Way back in 2014, when Edward Snowden had only been world-famous for a few months (thanks to his leaked NSA documents showcasing broad and deep government surveillance), there were those who noted we were willingly giving far more personal information to Apple and Facebook than what Uncle Sam was sucking up. But that kind of whataboutism only barely recognized that the motives behind state and business spying couldn't have less in common. Then Harvard academic and business columnist Shoshana Zuboff coined a term that might have seemed alarmist at the time, but now seems almost quaint: surveillance capitalism.There were already many examples of companies monetizing the massive amounts of digital data we were spewing out - through our phones and computers and transponders - and people may have noticed that it was getting a little creepy.Zuboff's new book argues that it was a) already much worse than we realized; b) much worse has happened since; and c) the worst is yet to come.Simply put, she calls surveillance capitalism \"a rogue force driven by novel economic imperatives that disregard social norms and nullify the elemental rights associated with individual autonomy.\" In other words, it's bad for you and bad for everyone else, too.Zuboff's initial essays on this topic explored how surveillance capitalism created a hugely lucrative \"surplus\" out of monitoring human activity (your tweets and likes may seem valueless, but when you collect all our tweets and likes, they are worth billions), and that insight has informed critiques of abuses enabled by practitioners such as Facebook (Cambridge Analytica, Trump, Brexit and fake news to name just a few).Her new book recaps how surveillance capitalism was born online, how it has begun to migrate into the physical world, how it has ripped traditional capitalism from its moorings and how it creates a futures market for human behaviour not merely to sell ads against, but also to be used to modify and shape our behaviour toward commercial ends.\"At its core surveillance capitalism is parasitic and self-referential. It revives Karl Marx's old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labour, but with an unexpected turn. Instead of labour, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human's experience,\" she writes.\"They accumulate vast domains of new knowledge from us, but not for us. They predict our futures for the sake of others' gain, not ours.\"This book is not a light read. It's packed with philosophy, business concepts, computer-science ideas and it doesn't hold your hand.It is also quite urgent in its attempt to sound the alarm. She warns that not only is our personal privacy at risk, but so, too, is our democracy and our economy. Capitalism itself, she warns, risks being destroyed by its mutant offspring.Here are some of the key takeaways.WE'RE ALREADY BEING EXPERIMENTED ON Facebook has famously bragged about the ability to make us happy or sad, to be more interested in voting or not, through modifications to our timeline. Pokemon Go! was a fun little game that got users to go to physical locations and catch animated characters, but the company behind it was letting companies pay - \"sponsored locations\"! - to get popular characters nearer to their stores and caf\u00e9s.Advertising is a nudge enabled by mass surveillance, but what if your car insurer installs a device that not only monitors your habits and readjusts your rates in real time, but puts a governor on the speed you can drive? Are you still free?And it's becoming ever harder to even know when you're being modified, what data is shaping an interaction and what choices are occluded.\"Surveillance capitalists know everything about us, whereas their operations are designed to be unknowable to us,\" Zuboff writes. \"In this future we are exiles from our own behaviour, denied access to our control over knowledge derived from our experiences.\"IT'S NOT JUST THE INTERNET - IT'S EVERYWHERE You might have heard the phrase \"If you're not paying, you're the product,\" which is a kind of snide way to dismiss anyone who complains about mass surveillance from Google (free, supported by ad sales) or Facebook (same).What Zuboff's new book says is that even companies you pay a lot of money to - insurance providers, automakers, telecom providers etc., now also want your data for free - because, under the logic of surveillance capitalism, everyone everywhere is always exploitable for data whether you want to be or not. We aren't even the product any more, she argues, we're the raw material - the coal in the smelter of surveillance capitalism.Google created surveillance capitalism in 2000-02, when it mined the vast data trove of the internet and the search terms people were using to find stuff on it in order to sell \"relevant\" ads back to those searchers.Silicon Valley quickly adopted the same techniques to greater (Facebook) or lesser effect (everybody else). Only more recently have the titans of the old economy realized what was happening and how they could profit, too.In November, Ford chief executive Jim Hackett suggested the company had a vast capacity for data mining its previously analogue products: \"We have 100 million people in vehicles today that are sitting in Ford blue-oval vehicles.That's the case for monetizing opportunity,\" he said in a Freakonomics Radio podcast.Now, companies are looking to build physical infrastructure from scratch that serves surveillance goals.In Canada, one of Alphabet Inc.'s (the holding company formerly known as Google) subsidiaries called Sidewalk Labs is in charge of creating and controlling a chunk of \"digital city\" - really a vast, sensored, monitored surveillance community. Zuboff keys in on The Globe and Mail's own coverage of the Sidewalk Toronto project on the city's waterfront. She notes former Google chairman Eric Schmidt's claim that Google's interest in building \"a city of the future\" comes from imagining \"all the things you could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge,\" and when Sidewalk was chosen to present a development plan for Quayside, he trumpeted: \"Now, it's our turn.\"'SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISTS KNOW TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR FREEDOM' One of Zuboff's fundamental arguments for why new types of regulation are needed is that surveillance capitalism doesn't behave like traditional market actors, and so it doesn't deserve the benefits of the free market.The capitalist theorists Western business thinkers turn to for guidance - Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Joseph Schumpeter - all understood a market that was equal parts mystery and free based on \"equally divided knowledge.\" The market was thought to be too complex to regulate, hence freedom.But surveillance capitalism attempts to remove all mystery. If surveillance capitalism creates something like a casino for brands to bet on our behaviour with ads, they also need to keep collecting ever more data to ensure the house (them) always wins. And while they know everything about us, we know nothing about them.Worse, she says, it abandons \"organic reciprocities,\" as described by Smith, that have enabled capitalism's appeal - where price increases had to be balanced with wage increases \"so that the labourer may still be able to purchase that quantity of those necessary articles which the state of the demand for labour requires that he should have.\" Because surveillance capitalism doesn't see people as consumers, but as assets to be farmed, Zuboff says \"social relations are no longer founded on mutual exchange. ... Products and services are merely hosts for surveillance capitalism's parasitic operations.\"SOLUTIONS \"We rely on categories such as 'monopoly' or 'privacy' to contest surveillance capital's practices\" says Zuboff, but the existing tools we have to address those issues don't come close to solving the problem.She is calling for something more fundamental - entirely new rights.Her main ideas are extensions of the European \"right to be forgotten.\" She calls for a right to a \"future tense,\" where we won't have our behaviour modified by unseen forces, and a \"right of sanctuary\" so we can opt out of all tracking.\"Will surveillance capitalism continue on its current trajectory to become the dominant logic of accumulation of our age, or, in the fullness of time, will we judge it to have been a toothed bird: a fearsome but ultimately doomed dead end in capitalism's longer journey?\" The key weakness of this toothed bird, Zuboff claims, is the anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian nature of a system run by a tiny elite of tech futurists. A form of \"tyranny that feeds on people but is not of the people. In a surreal paradox, this coup is celebrated as personalization.\"She quotes Thomas Paine: \"A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody, ought not to be trusted by anybody.\"So how politically volatile is a population that finds itself on the short side of a commercial relationship? Zuboff frames the American Revolution as essentially a consumer revolt when British taxes and tariffs imposed on colonists through the Stamp Act and Tea Act broke the market's reciprocity, and created enough political awareness to cause a violent break with their oppressors.Digital tea party anyone?"}, "SMH_1961": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Secure your mobile life Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon urges to be aware of the risks of smartphones and tablets.There's a six-month period of my toddler's life that is no longer digitally documented. No pictures, no voice recordings, no videos. He just suddenly goes from baby-faced to boy-featured.And it's his own fault. But it could equally have been a malicious impostor seeking to defraud me.My mini man wiped my (foolishly backup-less) iPhone by incorrectly keying in the PIN once too often; fraudsters can accomplish that and far worse in a variety of ways.And our lives are literally now stored on our smartphones. Google says Australians have the highest per capita uptake in the world behind Singapore, at 37 per cent. We also love our internet banking - we're 65 per cent more likely than a Brit and 14 per cent more likely than an American to do banking on our phones.As convenient as mobile technology is, it does leave us vulnerable. Common scams include: hoax messages that prompt you to reveal personal information; malware that if inadvertently downloaded can track your web surfing and keystrokes; fake phone surveys to trick you into divulging personal details; website scams designed to trap lots of people; and phone porting, where criminals switch your phone to another network to gain access to your calls and messages.So be sure to heed these simplified tips just released by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Bankers' Association to protect the valuable data on your various devices.GET CAGEYSet your smartphone and tablet - so mobile devices in particular - to lock. Then keep the pass codes secret. The same goes with net banking passwords and whatever you do don't make these the same as your device-unlock PIN or store them in a device that can be used for bank access. Your SIM needs a pin, too.Remember, all of the above PINs and codes need to be difficult to guess, including by someone with access to other details about you.Don't send any personal, PIN or account information by text either. This can be easily intercepted and might provide all that's needed for a fraudster to steal your identity.GET CLINGYBe really careful about the physical location of your digital device. Do you know where it is at all times? Is it secure? Are you sure no one is watching your activities over your shoulder? And - this one might not even have occurred to you - always delete any bank text messages, especially before lending it out, discarding or selling.All the tips so far are vital to ensure banks will refund, under the electronic funds transfer code, any defrauded money. You also need to alert them as soon as possible after unauthorised activity or you lose or have a device stolen (and providing your new mobile number will be vital if your bank does use SMS to authenticate transactions).GET CLUEYYou'd be unlikely to leave your home computer without a firewall and antivirus protection so, if you can get it, why would you do that to your tablet and smartphone? Keep the software up to date, too, as criminals constantly race to outsmart the defensive technology.Then make sure any financial apps are the real deal and download them only from official app stores. Some free downloads, programs, software and screensavers can hide malware.Don't conduct any banking using unsecured wi-fi networks or on non-standard devices.In terms of protecting data you share, actually read the privacy policies - those behind the \"do you agree to the terms and conditions\" box - before providing personal information. Are you really willing to accept how and for how long your details will be used?It's also worth making special mention here of one of the most successful fraud techniques: the hoax, pull-at-the-heart-strings email. Any such communication, no matter how desperate, worthy or impressive the backstory, or how generous the financial scenario, is geared at emptying your bank account.You should be incredibly sceptical of any unsolicited offer that seems too good to be true.Remember, too, that banks DO NOT email web page links and request your confidential details; scamsters do.GET CLEARSome mobile devices store copies of web pages, which could include banking information, so regularly clear your browser's cache (in settings). Always log out of net banking sessions.And my personal two cents - perhaps don't use your smartphone for all your photos and footage.Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon is the editor of afrsmartinvestor.com.au.

But the adoption of these cameras has created a new conflict over who has the right to view the recordings.In Seattle, where a dozen officers started wearing body cameras in a pilot program in December, the department has set up its own YouTube channel, broadcasting a stream of blurred images to protect the privacy of people filmed. Much of this footage is uncontroversial; one scene shows a woman jogging past a group of people and an officer watching her, then having a muted conversation with people whose faces have been obscured.''We were talking about the video and what to do with it, and someone said, 'What do people do with police videos?''' said Mike Wagers, chief operating officer of the Seattle police. His answer: ''They put it on YouTube.''But YouTube video from other police body cameras can be violent and disturbing. Scenes unfold slowly, in cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, as officers go about their work until a moment arrives when someone is suddenly shot and killed. Sometimes words are exchanged before the shootings, but often they occur in silence. The footage has little in common with the stylized deaths in Hollywood movies: There is often no sign of bleeding, and bodies lie twisted as if they have been broken.In Bremerton, Wash., the police chief, Steven Strachan, is wary about making such footage public. After testing body cameras last year, he decided not to buy them for his 71 officers because he feared that the state's public records laws would require him to turn over the film. Requests for footage, he said, would create an unwieldy administrative burden for his small department and could potentially violate privacy.''We hit the pause button,'' Chief Strachan said. ''Our view is we don't want to be part of violating people's privacy for commercial or voyeuristic reasons. Everyone's worst day is now going to be put on YouTube for eternity.''Since the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was shot and killed by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August, police departments have begun requiring officers to record their interactions with the public to hold them accountable for their behavior, as well as to protect them against false charges.Most big city American police departments - including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia - are still testing body cameras, and it could be at least a year before a significant number of officers in those cities are wearing them. But the battle over who has the right to see the  video is well underway.At public forums, including in Los Angeles, advocates for the cameras have pressed the police to make the footage public. They pointed to police killings of unarmed black men and boys that did not lead to criminal charges, saying recordings could provide a fuller view of events than police accounts or even witness testimony.Several killings have been captured by surveillance cameras or by bystanders with cellphones, like the death of Walter L. Scott, who was shot several times in the back by a police officer in North Charleston, S.C., this month.''If the public doesn't have the opportunity to view the video on their own, they are left with the police version of what happened, and as we've seen recently, their version isn't always what happened,'' said Laniece Williams, the spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Coalition for Racial, Economic and Legal Justice. ''Even in cases where there isn't a fatal shooting, there are instances where police brutalize people, and the public should be able to see the video.''But some state law makers are coming out against broad disclosure policies. Among a flurry of 87 bills related to body cameras that have been introduced in 29 legislatures, 15 states are moving to limit what the public is allowed to see of the recordings. In some cases, lawmakers have sought to remove the videos from public records laws, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures.''The issue challenges the assumption that everything that happens in public should be public,'' said James McMahan, the policy director for the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. ''But I don't know that we want a woman standing there with bruises and scratches and other signs of domestic violence to be posted on YouTube. The instance of her being posted online forever might be a greater crisis than the original incident.''In Philadelphia, where officers have fired at suspects at a rate of nearly once a week in the past eight years and where the city has paid out millions of dollars to victims of police brutality, residents have strongly called for officers to be equipped with body cameras.Activists like Ms. Williams of the justice coalition said they feared that much of the video will never be seen publicly. They point to the department's refusal to release surveillance camera footage of the death of Brandon Tate-Brown, 26, who was shot by the police in December after being stopped for driving with his headlights off.The Philadelphia police said that they had shown the video to Mr. Tate-Brown's family and that the department had not yet devised a policy on the release of video from body cameras.Some of the most intense discussion of the issue is taking place in Washington State, where the law allows anyone to file a public records request to obtain body camera recordings. In Bremerton, where Chief Strachan tested body cameras before deciding not to purchase them, the chief said the demands the department had received for video during the testing period had been too burdensome. ''We got a request for any and all video shot by a police officer,'' he said. ''It's pretty much impossible.''In nearby King County, Sheriff John Urquhart said he would not equip his deputies with cameras until lawmakers reworked disclosure rules. ''I'd do it in a heartbeat,'' he said, ''but if the public wants body cameras, they're going to have to give something up on public disclosure.''Legislation being considered in the State House of Representatives would generally limit access to the recordings to civilians directly involved in the encounter. Representative Drew Hansen, who introduced the bill, said there had been public records requests for ''anything interesting,'' including barroom fights.But Mr. Wagers, the chief operating officer of the Seattle police, said he understood that the proliferation of body cameras had whetted the public's appetite for access to the footage. The department, he said, is testing 12 body cameras but plans to outfit 900 patrol officers in 2016. He said the ultimate goal was to post online every moment of officers' body camera recordings.''What's the purpose of collecting the data?'' he asked. ''To move to accountability and get to the truth.''"}, "TDP_118": {"true_label": "01", "text": "of worms LAWYER and privacy expert Barbara Buckett says this is often what leads to trouble. Online privacy is a particular can of worms.\"That's a clear place where there needs to be more attention . . . because the legislation just isn't keeping pace with where things are going, particularly in social media and the like.\"It's so wide and open and there doesn't seem to be that much respect. Even on Facebook - I can get, or anybody can get, access to a whole lot of information.\"Debate has raged over issues such as whether anything posted on social networking sites is indeed in the public arena and therefore fair game for anyone, such as the media, to use.Ms Schroff says that, though the bulk of the commission's 6000 annual inquiries and 1000 complaints are mainly from people prevented from accessing their own information and concern unlawful disclosure, the bigger problems are about the development of huge information systems.\"The flexibility with which that information can be swapped, used and disclosed is probably the main generic issue for us.\"Government departments, banks and consumer reward programmes, with their huge databases, are described by Mr Olson as a boon for anyone seeking information.Ms Shroff says our personal information needs stronger legal protection. \"The best way to protect people's information is by getting those agencies to handle those huge databases well.\"She hopes this will be covered by a Law Commission report expected to be made public soon. After a four-year study of the privacy legislation, she expects the report will award regulators such as the commission more power to target those who are non- compliant. Privacy protection is also starting to gain momentum around the world and last year New Zealand joined the Global Privacy Enforcement Network.The network, set up to enhance trans-national co-operation about privacy, is being led by the US Federal Trade Commission, which is taking complaints from international citizens about breaches by US companies.Although they would select what they followed up, the recent censure of Google over its illegal collection of wi-fi data effectively forced the internet giant to sign a 20-year good behaviour bond.\"That shows you that our sister or brother regulator in another country is acting in the interests of not only its own citizens but also internationally,\" Ms Shroff says.But while the legislative framework is changing and agencies such as Netsafe and even big businesses that understand the need to protect valuable information are joining the movement to help make people more aware, much of the onus needs to be placed on the individual, she says.\"People are their own best watchdogs. We are the watchdog agency for this booming field, this hugely growing and dynamic field - but we can't be holding everybody's hand every time they're shopping online or filling in their social networking page or sending emails to companies or whatever it may be.\"In her time as the privacy commissioner, awareness has increased, she says. \"As the online world has grown at a huge rate, inevitably people's attention has been drawn more and more to that fact that they're taking risks when they go online.\""}, "SMH_4077": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Libs' site a 'mean and tricky ruse';Election 2016 Privacy campaigners have accused the Liberal Party of an \"appalling\" sleight of hand for using what looks like an official government website to harvest people's personal information.The Australian Privacy Foundation's David Vaile says the website, which spruiks the government's $840 million PaTH to Jobs internship program, appears to be deliberately misleading.It asks employers and job seekers to register their interest in the program by submitting their personal details. But it's only in the well-hidden fine print that it makes it clear it is a party website rather than a government one.The Coalition scheme is designed to encourage those under the age of 25 to get jobs, by giving them a $200-a-fortnight top-up over and above the dole to work 25 hours a week. It is a central plank of the government's jobs and growth agenda but it has drawn heavy fire from the unions, which have described it as a $4-an-hour \"worker exploitation scheme\".Mr Vaile says the website may be a political trawling exercise, a \"mean and tricky ruse\" to get information for political purposes.\"They have pushed the concept of informed consent to the limit by not revealing anywhere that it is not actually the Turnbull government a reader is dealing with, but a party organisation,\" he said.\"It is an appalling approach to abusing the trust of gullible internet users and getting their personal information by sleight of hand.\"It gives little confidence that they can be trusted to look after personal information ... privacy and confidentiality concerns.\"Mr Vaile says the information collected can be stolen by a \"motivated intruder\", putting people at risk of identity theft.The ACTU says the website is yet another strike against the program. \"Not only does the government want to exploit young workers, now we're seeing an attack on their privacy as well, with their details being funnelled into a Liberal Party campaign database,\" ACTU secretary Dave Oliver said.The Coalition has refused to answer questions about the website, simply referring Fairfax Media to the site's privacy policy, which reads: \"Information is being collected by the Liberal Party because it is caretaker and no government agency can do so.\"Once the election caretaker period is over, the party will provide the information to the Department of Employment, the policy says.\"The information collected will not be used for any other purpose,\" it says."}, "SMH_4458": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Should you stalk your child's smartphone? The best online protection children can have is active monitoring, reports Catherine Armitage.With smartphones, handhelds and Wi-Fi hotspots everywhere, keeping an eye over your child's shoulder on the home computer is so last century. Instead surveillance apps let you track your offspring's every text, call, social media photo and website visit without them knowing. But should you?Why you may want toKids today don't just have the world at their feet, they carry it around in their pockets on their smartphones. But what if they're cyberbullied? Groomed online by a paedophile?The biggest survey of sexting in Australia by the Australian Institute of Criminology found that one in two out of 1200 teenagers had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves.In a recent poll of Australian teenagers, nearly half (48 per cent) said they had lied to a parent about what they do online or on an app. Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) admitted to having a secret account their parents didn't know about, and 58 per cent said they hid stuff from their parents on their phones or devices.More than 90 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls aged 13-16 said they'd seen pornography online. More than 80 per cent of the boys and more than 60 per cent of the girls in the survey of 700 teenagers said they'd been exposed to sexual comments.And 30 per cent of Australian 9- to 16-year-olds in a 2011 study reported encountering something online that upset or bothered them.Why you probably shouldn'tUnder the NSW Surveillance Devices Act it is illegal in most circumstances to monitor and record someone's private conversations without their consent. The TeenSafe app, which claims 1 million users in the US, requires you to certify it will be used only to monitor children for whom you are the legal guardian. There may be a legal grey area if a child is mature enough to provide or withhold informed consent, says David Vaile, co-convenor, Cyberspace Law and Policy Community at the University of NSW. It's \"parenting by remote\" says Susan McLean, a Victorian police officer who now travels the country speaking to schools and parents on cybersafety. The people selling monitoring apps prey on vulnerable, panicked, time-poor parents, and \"if you have those sort of trust issues, you have a lot more problems than what your child is doing on the internet\", she says.You can also get a false sense of security and your child is potentially a few steps ahead anyway, by either switching to a device you don't know about or using masking apps that hide their activities, says Alastair MacGibbon, Children's E-safety Commissioner. Depending on their age and stage, it's an invasion of their privacy, \"just as you would not read their diary or go into their room unannounced\", says Marilyn Campbell, Professor of Education at the Queensland University of Technology and a cyberbullying expert.Children need to be exposed to some level of risk online so they can develop the skills, practices and attitudes to deal with it, says Amanda Third, principal research fellow in digital and social cultural research at Western Sydney University.The notion you can prevent anything bad from happening to them online is a \"dangerous delusion\", Mr Vaile says.Here's a better ideaThe devices through which children get into trouble are usually provided to them by their parents, often at an early age, points out Professor Campbell. She rejects the plea of ignorance from parents who say they can't keep up with their kids online because they don't know how the devices work. If you don't understand smart phones, you shouldn't be buying them for your children, she says.Your responsibility is the same as if you were teaching your child to ride a bike, she says. First of all you show them how to do it, then you ride with them for a while, you give them rules, make sure they wear a helmet, and gradually let them go about more independently as they become more skilled and experienced.The conversations \"need to start very young\", Dr Third says. \"The moment you start to show them your iPad or show them a photo online, however innocuous those moments might seem, they are the opportunities to talk to your children about what good media practices look like and how [your] family's values align with that.\"As children get older, experts recommend you actively monitor their online activities.\"I realise it is hard but this is about constantly having conversations with your kids about what they are seeing and what they do online, how they do it and who they are speaking to.\"Surveillance by device is a \"potentially serious breach of trust which can interfere with the open communication that appears to be at the heart of the process of gradually developing resilience\", says Mr Vaile.Dr Third says research shows \"very compellingly\" that the best online protection children can have is active monitoring plus the security of a set of values and principles that help them to make sense of what they see online and to deal with it, by clicking away and by talking to a trusted adult if they are upset.And a quick reality checkDr Third points out that the children who are the most vulnerable online are the same children who are most vulnerable offline, for example those without a trusted adult to turn to.Fewer parents will feel the kind of anxiety around their kids' phone and internet use as this generation of relatively clueless parents become grandparents. Then the parents will be digital natives born since 1995, for whom none of this is a mystery and safe digital practices are simply common sense.

She went back on Facebook.\"It was that yearning for connection. We are all just sort of craving it,\" Giffin, 49, says. \"You really do get this sense that we are all in this together on Facebook. You can see people's worry and their heartache.\"Users like Giffin thought they had deleted Facebook from their lives forever. Then came COVID-19 and a new age of social distancing. With the majority of the U.S. population on lockdown and under orders to stay physically apart, some are returning to the giant social network, if only to get through the current crisis.They share their fears and anxieties, home-cooked meals, goofy or tender moments with kids and pets and loads of coronavirus memes. Religious services and public health briefings draw big crowds as do streamed fitness classes and dance parties. Then there are all the calls and messages for life-and-death updates.Facebook won't disclose any specifics on increased users or usage during the pandemic but recently said that Italians are spending 70% more time on all its apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, with major spikes in messaging, phone calls and live streaming. Audience and advertising measurement firm Comscore reports that U.S. visits to Facebook rose 7% the week of March 9 and 11% the week of March 16.Created to bring people together, in recent years Facebook has driven wedges instead.Scandal after Facebook scandal - rampant misinformation and Russian interference in the presidential election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal that compromised tens of thousands of accounts, the mishandling of personal information - riled users to the point that some decided to desert their online besties rather than stick around.Encroaching isolation during the pandemic has melted that resolve. Even some of Facebook's sharpest critics are logging in again. Veteran technology journalist Walt Mossberg, who denounced the company's policies and deactivated his account in 2018, says he has relented for now.\"With this pandemic, I need to keep in touch with friends &amp; family who simply aren't on Twitter,\" Mossberg wrote on Facebook. But, he says, after the pandemic ends, \"I'll quit again.\"On Facebook duringthe pandemic onlyThe same goes for Giffin.Before her feet hit the floor the morning after Donald Trump was elected, Giffin deactivated Facebook. Six months later, she revived her account but only to pop in once in a while to catch up with friends or linger over that day's memories.She still blames Facebook for the spread of disinformation during the 2016 presidential election. But for now, she has swallowed her misgivings to connect with friends each day, like the husband-and-wife restaurant owners she met on last year's trip to northern Italy who chronicled their new normal - kids out of school playing puzzles or music at home - as this reality gradually mirrored her own.On Sundays, Giffin goes to church on Facebook. She shares articles about the coronavirus to keep her community up to date. And last week, after self-imposed silence, she fired off her first Facebook post in three years, pleading with friends and neighbors to take the nation's life-and-death struggle with the coronavirus more seriously and stay indoors. It got nearly 100 likes.These quick hits of companionship on Facebook have helped Giffin cope, much like the off-screen moments she treasures, when her teenage boys challenge her to a game of Boggle or cozy up for a family meal. She's been delighted to discover more connection, and less conflict, on Facebook than before.But the minute the pandemic retreats, Giffin says, so will she. \"I believe the worst of us will still be there when this is all over,\" she says, \"so I will be checking out.\"Some Facebook users who have returned during the pandemic aren't sure how long they will stay. Thomas Tseng, 48, a market research professional from Los Angeles, says he never really quit Facebook, just removed the app from his phone about three years ago. He'd log in from time to time to receive birthday wishes or when he was tagged in a post.Fake news and bogus conspiracy theories in the run-up to the election, then the countless privacy incursions, wore on him.\"I finally decided it wasn't worth my time,\" he says. Tseng still uses Instagram, as many die-hard Facebook critics do, but he felt it was important to boycott the company's namesake app.Then, a few weeks ago, he logged back in to Facebook. He says he didn't want to be disconnected from friends and relatives during the coronavirus. But he notes, he's less engaged than he was before. \"So it's still up in the air if this is a temporary or more permanent move,\" Tseng says.Not even a pandemiccould drag them backOther longtime holdouts say nothing, not even a terrifying pandemic, could coax them back.Eric Tollevsen, 48, quit Facebook four years ago to escape the political bickering and hasn't been back since. A visual merchandiser who moved from New York to Los Angeles a few months ago, he texts his loved ones instead.\"To be honest, I can't foresee a situation where I would ever go back to Facebook,\" Tollevsen says.Mike Mierendorf, 36, a business consultant from Minneapolis, can't either. He deleted his Facebook account in 2018 as his distrust of the service grew and usage petered out. Video and group chat apps have kept him, his wife and their two young kids, in touch with friends and family.There's a standing Thursday night Zoom get-together with friends in Denver, where Mierendorf used to live. One side of the family gathers on GoToMeeting. Nearly every day, parents and siblings connect over FaceTime.His daughter visits with classmates at her Montessori preschool on Houseparty. His son chats and shares silly messages with his kindergarten class on the Marco Polo app. At night when the kids are tucked in bed, he and his wife play virtual games with their neighbors on Zoom.\"If this quarantine has accomplished anything that is good, it is that we are connecting with people more regularly than we had before,\" Mierendorf said. \"Friends and family are all ensuring we stay connected however we need to.\"Just not on Facebook.

And a paper released on Tuesday by a group of Oxford University researchers concluded such a solution would help contain the virus: a major outbreak would overwhelm traditional contact tracing (where officials interview victims about their movements, to understand who they might have infected).In some parts of the world, digital contact tracing means harvesting cellphone location data - effectively giving the state permission to see the movements of their phone-carrying people and raising huge privacy issues.But Singapore's success in persuading over 600,000 citizens to use a bluetooth- based app called Trace Together offers a more palatable, less invasive alternative that civil liberties campaigners would accept - and it seems logical that any New Zealand app would mimic.The Oxford study, published by Science Today, argued that the virus spreads too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing - but could be controlled by a faster, more efficient and bigger digital system which could \"play a critical role\" in countries avoiding or leaving lockdowns.Professor Shaun Hendy, director of the Te Punaha Matatini research centre, says the Oxford research shows that once New Zealand leaves lockdown, we will need digital assistance to stay out of level four conditions.\"The traditional way of contact tracing for disease appears to be too slow, without the lockdown effect,\" says Hendy.\"One big effect of the lockdown is to help contact tracers stay ahead of the disease. But if we are going to come off lockdown and go back down to level three or level two, I do think we need to be looking at new solutions.\"Tech entrepreneur Craig Squire first contacted the Government in March to suggest it look closely at developing a contact tracing app and says others in the tech sector did the same.\"I would be very surprised if the Government wasn't already quite advanced in its thinking on a digital solution to support contact tracing,\" he said.Worldwide, researchers are racing to develop such apps, including groups in the United States and a cross-European collaboration.Solutions so far range from the less liberal - The Economist reported Chinese officials instructing victims to add them to their WhatsApp contacts, then leave location tracking turned on so they could be constantly surveilled, and there have been accusations the Iranians were using a Covid-19 diagnostic app to covertly track users.But in the West, apps that log phone GPS data - such as a planned app being produced by an MIT professor, Ramesh Raskar - also have their privacy implications.Singapore's Trace Together sidesteps that to some extent. It requires bluetooth to be switched on, and when another phone running both the app and bluetooth comes within range, they swap and store information.Dr Andrew Chen, a researcher specialising in digital transformation at Auckland University's Centre for Informed Futures, says Trace Together had some technical issues, but the bluetooth option was less invasive than using GPS, is short range, and gives governments no opportunity to spy on your signals as you move.What it offers isn't location, but proximity: that is, not where you were, but who you met, which is the key element of contact tracing (although locations do help map hotspots and patterns).There are privacy implications for both, notes Chen, \"but trying to track those contacts and relationships is probably safer than having the [state know the] position of every single person in the country at once.\"Thomas Beagle, spokesman for the New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties, ran an informal Twitter survey of his followers to ask if they would install a digital contact tracing app on their phones if the Government asked them to.More than half replied that they would. He thinks he would, too - under certain circumstances.Beagle says the Singaporean model looks the best, in terms of providing the data needed while building in privacy protections.He'd want it enshrined that the data could only be used for contact tracing - not shared with other agencies, such as police, or the MSD, who might want it for other motives, and he'd want an assurance it was turned off when the Covid-19 crisis ends.\"If the Government came out strongly and said 'we want you to install something, here's where we are taking precautions, here's where we are taking precautions, here's how it can't be used for anything other than pandemic tracing, here's how we will turn this off when it is all over' - I think people would actually take it,\" he says.\"I would install that app, and I would encourage my partner too and other people.\"Squire said the right app would meet five requirements - having the biggest impact on community transmission, being the most useful for contact tracers, the most achievable, the most acceptable to the public, and capable of meeting the law.\"I think there is a sweet spot to be debated - I think people want to help, but there is, I think, a degree of suspicion generally about data collection and concerns for privacy (and of course we have privacy legislation supporting this).\"That said, I think this Government, and indeed successive governments, have earned some capital and there is a higher degree of trust in New Zealand than other parts of the world.\"Whatever it looks like - and of course, a bluetooth app wouldn't be of use if we later discover coronavirus is particularly transmissible from touching a surface previously touched by someone infectious - Hendy says New Zealand's app doesn't have to be ready by the time we exit lockdown. Instead, he says, we could see it as a medium-term weapon in what will be a long war.And he says, we don't all have to use it (or accept it) for it to be useful. \"Even if 10 to 15 per cent of us were doing it, that could be really substantial,\" says Hendy.\"To take some of the load off the manual contact tracers would be fantastic and make the whole system work a lot better.\"And, he says, if you really don't like the idea at all - keep a diary. The contact tracers would still thank you for it."}, "AFR_463": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Cyber pain is insurers' gain Major Australian companies are scrambling to secure cyber insurance to cover themselves for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in the wake of the Alan Jones social media campaign and a string of shareholder class actions for data security breaches.In a flying visit to Australia, global cyber insurance practice leader at insurance giant Aon, Kevin Kalinich, has met with leading Australian companies across banking, superannuation, retail and healthcare, as they hit the panic button over new technology risks.Cyber insurance has exploded from a $200 million market just four years ago and is soon expected to reach $1 billion a year in premiums.\"The top 70 advertisers for the radio station had attacks on their emails, on their social media systems, on their call centres, so the developments in technology has created new exposures that were not present 10 years ago, five years ago, even three years ago,\" Mr Kalinich said.\"There are a number of cases going through the courts now where insurers are denying coverage rather than willingly paying for a large catastrophic loss [unless they have specific cyber insurance],\" Mr Kalinich said.The companies Aon met this week are taking up coverage of up to $100 million - the average loss in Australia for a data breach is $2.16 million - but are increasingly seeking to ensure they are covered for social media risks as well, including Facebook, Twitter and the risk of online activists.\"If you can demonstrate to the underwriters that you have good training and practices with your employees, then you can cover defamation, slander, libel, copyright, trademark. They can be included in the cyber liability placement but you have to have good practices in place,\" he said.Companies are also being spurred into action by potential shareholder class actions. Apple shareholders, for example, have filed a proposal seeking a report from the board on how the tech giant is dealing with privacy and data security concerns. Electronics giant Sony had 77 million customer identifications hacked and stolen last year, losing $US280 million in revenue and racking up 55 class action lawsuits into the bargain.The majority of US laws now require mandatory disclosure of data breaches, and the US regulator requires companies to disclose their level of cyber insurance.Europe is also proposing mandatory 24-hour notice for data breaches and potential fines of 2 per cent of revenue.Mr Kalinich predicts that current changes to Australian privacy laws will bring the wave of new class actions to our shores.\"The ambulance chasing lawyers have quit chasing ambulances and are now chasing big class actions for data breaches,\" he said.\"At the same time, companies have been introducing mobile devices, memory sticks, cloud computing and social media to accentuate the issues,\" he said. \"They are going to come to Australia, there has been an exponential increase in lawsuits after you introduce a change to the privacy laws,\" he warned.KPMG estimates that 75 per cent of the 1000 largest Australian companies have had a material data breach and the amendments to Australia's Privacy Act will require disclosure to the Privacy Commissioner.\"Businesses rate technology and cyber security as one of the highest long-term risks to their operations,\" KPMG IT partner Ian Hancock said.\"As well as basic things such as good passwords, organisations need to be aware of situations where large volumes of data could be disclosed or compromised,\" he said.Super funds are among the range of Australian businesses struggling with the reality of today's enormous amount of aggregated data.\"For large investors, grappling with this data deluge is like drinking from a fire hose. The challenge is how to seize upon their data opportunities to better engage with members,\" William Fraser, head of eSolutions for JPMorgan, told a Technology Summit in Sydney this week."}, "NZH_3073": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Editorial: Embarrassing old data a different issue from privacy Do we have a \"right to be forgotten\"? The proposition would have seemed absurd before the advent of the internet and its search engines. But it has become a question of some moment since the European Union\"s Court of Justice decided last week that Google ought to wipe \"irrelevant\" or \"outdated\" data on request.The court was ruling on a case concerning a Spanish citizen who found that when his name was put into Google\"s search engine it brought up a 1998 newspaper announcement for an auction of his repossessed house for the recovery of a debt. Mario Costeja Gonzales said the debt proceedings against him had been fully resolved for a number of years and he contended that further reference to them was unfair and irrelevant.Spain\"s data protection agency agreed with him, ordering Google Spain and Google Inc to remove the item from their index and ensure further access to it was impossible. Google challenged that decision in the National High Court, which referred the issues to the EU court. Its ruling has created a fearsome technical challenge for search engines which are fairly passive scanners of data entered by others, especially news media, but it is the principle that matters.Do people have a right to expunge their personal record of references to things they regret? In real life this is not possible. We may wish certain incidents to be forgotten but there is no \"right\" to demand it. Memories that others retain can linger longer than they should, longer sometimes than in the mind of the person concerned, such is human nature\"s capacity for selective recall.Do we have a right to stop people mentioning these things to others if it happened long ago and is \"irrelevant\" to us now? The European Court wants Google to make that decision on complaints from the person concerned. Within a few days of the ruling, people were asking Google to remove references to crime, tax dodging, love affairs, professional suspension, even customer complaints against a product or service.Crime might seem the least deserving of a right to be forgotten but crime already has law that can remove an offence from official records after a decent interval. Wiping all reference from the internet, though, is not as simple. No publisher can control the spread of information once it is on the web.If search engine administrators are to be held responsible, how are they to decide who deserves protection? The easiest to refuse would be applications from celebrities or other public figures.The European Court was careful to exclude them from protection. The public has a right to know what they have done. The difficult cases will involve people whose name brings up very few items on a Google search. Their only record may be the reference to an embarrassment long ago.But the fact that it is the only record of them gives it added value as a public resource. The solution to their complaint may be not to remove them from the web but to invite them to write what they want the world to know about them, just as millions do on social sites.A \"right to be forgotten\" is being asserted as a right to privacy, but it is not the same. Privacy is a right to be protected from intrusion or publication of personal information that you can reasonably expect to remain private. The information that people may want wiped from the web is likely to be material that would not be covered by a right to privacy at the time it occurred.Time, they argue, makes a difference. Maybe, but it does not make it private."}, "USA_1080": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Google's purchase of Nest prompts more privacy fears Google announced Monday that it is buying Nest, a company that makes smart thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion.Google has enough info about my digital life.

''This is no casual process.''However, according to reports, the Prism program gathers metadata - information about patterns and locations of communications - rather than content.Asked by Douglas Alexander, spokesman for foreign affairs from the opposition Labour Party, what controls apply over requests from GCHQ for information based on searches of foreign databases - rather than intercepts - Mr. Hague did not give a specific response.''Because circumstances vary and because procedures vary according to the situation, I don't want to give a categoric answer,'' Mr. Hague told British lawmakers, though he added that ''ministerial oversight, independent scrutiny is there.''''The idea that operations are carried without ministerial oversight, somehow getting around U.K. law is a mistaken idea,'' Mr. Hague added.Last week, The Guardian newspaper reported that GCHQ, generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the year to May 2012. GCHQ has refused to comment on the details of the claims but said in a statement that its work ''is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.''According to experts the legal situation remains opaque. ''We are told this is lawful but the precise nature of these legal judgements are hidden from us,'' said Richard Aldrich professor of international security at the University of Warwick who argued that intelligence agencies now had access to enormous stores of information that could be cross-checked with other data to build up a profile of individuals' lives.''The last 10 years has been about working out how to warehouse unbelievable amounts of boring data and how to analyze that data - and they have cracked it,'' Mr. Aldrich said. Through such a process it would be possible for the authorities ''to have a better memory of what I was doing 10 months ago than I have,'' he added.Politicians in continental Europe have expressed concerns. ''All our e-mails and other electronic communication, including social media, even if sent only between European Union citizens, can be intercepted and read by U.S. security services,'' said Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the center political grouping in the European Parliament and a former prime minister of Belgium. ''This has obvious and very serious privacy consequences for E.U. citizens.''Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron spoke in defense of the British intelligence agencies, also insisting they were operating within the law.''I see every day the vital work they do to keep us safe,'' he said while answering questions after a speech in Essex, ''but it is vital work that is done under a legal framework within the law and subject to proper scrutiny by the intelligence and security committee.''The intelligence services operate within the law, within the law that we have laid down, and they are also subject to proper scrutiny by the intelligence and security committee of the House of Commons,'' he said.Though he added that he was satisfied that British agencies operate in a proper way, Mr. Cameron also said that the government could not give a ''running commentary'' on intelligence issues.In Parliament, Labour's spokesman, Mr. Alexander, praised the work of the intelligence services but called for reassurances ''in recognition of the depth of public concern that has arisen in recent days.''''Our intelligence agencies' work would be more difficult if levels of concern about the framework under which they operate were to compromise the existing active support of the public for their efforts,'' Mr . Alexander added.Several lawmakers challenged Mr. Hague, some demanding assurances that their communications - or those of campaigners - were not being monitored.

He added that Spain had not received official confirmation of the alleged spying, but that it has demanded the US provide all the necessary information. The rift between Europe and the US has led to some calls to hold up transatlantic trade talks and other forms of cooperation, including access to the SWIFT banking system, until a new protocol to limit NSA spying is agreed.

We just need to adjust that. We need to pay attention to the scale and proportionality of what's going on.\" The article about spying on Spain was written for El Mundo by Glenn Greenwald, the American journalist, who has worked with Snowden to publish the NSA spying revelations. It stated that on one day alone, Dec 11, a total of 3.5 million calls were recorded. \"The interception carried out by the United States also includes the intrusion in personal information through the internet browser, email and social networks such as Twitter and Facebook,\" the authors write.

Within a week, he pleaded no contest in court to two attempted larceny charges and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\"I truly believe this is the Neighborhood Watch of 2020,\" said Livonia Police Capt.

Law enforcement can join, too, and view comments or videos that users post inside and outside their jurisdiction.Law enforcement goes through Ring to make a video request and must reference a relevant case and videos within a limited time and area. Ring doesn't provide information about users unless a user chooses to share video with police. Then, the user's email and address are disclosed.Users can say no and opt out of future requests. Police said they don't have direct access to a user's system.The Free Press couldn't find examples of law enforcement using a warrant to obtain video, but would likely have the legal right to do so.The Detroit Police Department signed an agreement, \"but that doesn't mean the officers have the authority to use it,\" Deputy Chief Grant Ha said.Ha said some people have been trained on how to use the app and the department is developing policies and standard operating procedures.\"It not the investigative tool, but an investigative tool,\" Ha said.At the Livonia Police Department, Taig said, the partnership has been \"nothing but successful for us.\"\"If I'm a crime victim, there's at least a chance to get this person because we have them on video,\" he said. \"It's probably not for everybody.\" "}, "TG_10487": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Counter-terrorism was never meant to be Silicon Valley's job.

The European Union has created a draft law to make social media companies crack down on extremism or face steep fines. \"It has become the responsibility of the tech giants, against their own will, because law enforcement are simply not able to do this,\" said Carl Miller, Research Director of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media at think tank Demos. \"This is partly a law enforcement capacity issue and partly because tech giants don't want to give states access to large amounts of data.\"Twitter, Facebook and Google have announced measures to tackle the problem, including suspending accounts, using artificial intelligence to identify extreme content, hiring more content moderators, developing and supporting \"counter-speech\" campaigns, and creating a shared industry database of hashes - unique digital fingerprints - for violent terrorist images.Facebook has assembled a team of dozens of low-paid contractors to not only remove terrorist propaganda but carry out in-depth investigations into suspicious users that include tracking their location and reading private messages, the Guardian has learned. The counter-terrorism unit has special clearance to carry out investigations into user accounts if they are suspected of having links to terrorist groups identified by the US state department.Full account access is granted to any profile once it has been flagged by algorithms looking for certain names, images or hashtags associated with terrorist groups - including Islamic State and Al-Qaida - or by user reports. Related:  Theresa May wants tech companies to censor terrorists, but will they play ball?Moderators will then access the individual's private messages, see who they are talking to and what they are saying, and view where they have been.The team's highest priority is to identify \"traveling fighters\" for Isis and Al-Qaida. Someone would be categorized as such if their profile has content that's sympathetic to extremism and if they had, for example, visited Raqqa in Syria before traveling back to Europe. When a traveling fighter is identified - which according to one insider takes place at least once a day - the account is escalated to an internal Facebook team that decides whether to pass information to law enforcement. If a flagged account made any specific threat within a message, it would also be escalated.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment about these investigations.Twitter has faced a different challenge. The company has a history of fiercely defending free speech and anonymity online, where Facebook and Google have pushed for real names. studies have shown that Twitter has been one of Isis's preferred tools for spreading propaganda and funnelling people into private messaging apps such as Telegram.A former Twitter employee said that the company takes the problem extremely seriously, partly for legal reasons. In May, Twitter, Facebook and Google were sued by relatives of victims  of the San Bernardino attack for knowingly supporting Islamic State and its extremist agenda.\"They could get hit with aiding and abetting someone on the terrorist watch list,\" he said.\"It's also not good business to have people lopping off heads and using your company as part of that terrorist mechanism.\"Accounts that are clearly Isis related are taken down. And there have been a lot of takedowns: Twitter suspended 376,890 accounts for violations related to promotion of terrorism in the second half of 2016 alone.It's all bullshit. It's an effort to generate a veneer of corporate responsibility  Michael Smith, terrorism analyst    At Google, YouTube is the platform favored by jihadists and hate preachers, although Google Docs and Google Plus are also used. Not only is YouTube hosting propaganda, but it was making money out of it: earlier this year it was discovered that the ad campaigns of major brands were appearing alongside hate preachers. This led to a mass exodus of advertisers until YouTube pledged to clamp down on the problem.The company has been experimenting with the \" Redirect Method \", which delivers ads alongside search queries commonly used by people attracted to Isis. The ads link to Arabic and English channels featuring videos that counter Isis brainwashing such as testimonials from former extremists and imams denouncing Isis's corruption of Islam.Even with these measures in place, experts criticize the social media companies as ineffective. \"It's all bullshit. It's an effort to generate a veneer of corporate responsibility for the benefit of their shareholders that is frankly anything but that,\" said terrorism analyst Michael Smith, who said the tech companies \"understand the issues\" but have \"about a one-inch deep knowledge of a two-mile deep pond of centuries old issues\".Hany Farid, senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project, agrees.\"They spend huge resources developing technology to find the data about users to target advertising,\" he said. \"I'm 100% sure that if they put even a fraction of that effort into building an early warning system they could make an impact.\"It takes minutes to find a plethora of terrorist content, including a Facebook page with a recruitment video celebrating the martyrdom of a Canadian jihadi (which Facebook deemed OK when reported). On YouTube it's easy to find videos of English-speaking Isis fighters calling for American radicals to \"stab a kafir with a knife, throw him off a building or run him over with a car.\".Islamic State has become increasingly sophisticated at peddling propaganda. Every communication is distributed like a multi-media ad campaign, with well-produced videos, radio shows and branded hashtags.The content is amplified by an army of pro-Isis media groups that push it out across the internet, uploading videos hundreds of times in different locations to make it harder to police.\"Social media companies don't understand that it's a systemic problem across the whole online universe. That's why the terrorists are winning,\" said Eric Feinberg from cyber intelligence firm GIPEC. \"They need to block communications strands, not individual accounts.\"The agreement to come together to tackle the problem is a start. If the tech companies aren't seen to be doing more, they may be forced to by regulators.Europe has already proposed such a crackdown and Smith believes it won't be more than two years until another \"mass-casualty\" domestic attack makes the United States follows suit. Regulators may want tech companies to ensure they can better identify and locate their users (a \" know your customer \" for social media) and more actively police their networks for terrorist propaganda - proposals civil liberties campaigners will baulk at. The prospect of policymakers intervening may be enough to twist the arms of US-headquartered tech companies into self-regulation, Smith said.This wouldn't, of course, be a panacea for terrorism, but it could make it harder for extremists to find new recruits. \"If it all disappeared tomorrow, it would be a tremendous win for global security. If you pushed Islamic State into darker spaces on the web the influence and capacity to recruit and incite violence would be vastly diminished.\"                     Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com"}, "GM_3973": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Facebook Canada's managing director on rebuilding trust amid controversy;Garrick Tiplady breaks down how important safety, transparency and privacy are to the social-media firm Facebook Inc. has been under the gun in the wake of revelations about how user data were collected, and exploited for political purposes. On Monday, an analyst report warned of a temporary pullback in advertising and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission confirmed it's investigating the social network's privacy practices.The data issue has reverberations in Canada: Christopher Wylie, the man who helped found Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the heart of the controversy, and then became its whistle-blower, is Canadian and has done work with the federal Liberal Party. Mr. Wylie has also said he helped start a B.C.-based consultancy company that did work helping the \"leave\" side of the Brexit vote to circumvent campaign spending laws.In his first interview since taking on the head job at Facebook Canada in December, Garrick Tiplady talked to The Globe and Mail about his priorities for the company and rebuilding trust with its users.The Cambridge Analytica situation has deep Canadian roots. The question that may raise in some Canadians' minds is: We've seen Brexit, we've seen the U.S. election. Are the upcoming elections in Canada vulnerable? First and foremost, it's our job to ensure the platform is safe. We launched, several months ago, the Elections Integrity Initiative, coming out of what we saw in the U.S. Within Canada specifically, coming out of the [Communications Security Establishment] report [in June, which warned that \"hacktivist groups will deploy cybercapabilities in an attempt to influence the democratic process in 2019\"], there are really two main initiatives. One is cybersecurity, making sure that if any parliamentarian has been hacked, there is an immediate response. In addition we're working with MediaSmarts on digital literacy, making sure people have information so they can make educated decisions about what they see. That's where \"view ads\" comes in. [A tab on the Facebook pages of political parties and brands that will show any ads that page is running, and each ad's target audience.] It's the next level of standards around transparency. We've rolled that out in Canada and we're planning to roll it out globally.The events of last week related to data that were being shared with friends through an app. That was shut down three years ago. We take full responsibility for that, and we're putting in more processes to make sure that doesn't happen again.We're adding 10,000 people [globally] in the organization - so going from 10,000 to [eventually] 20,000, we're at 14,000 now - solely focused on safety and security on the platform. We're continuing to invest so we're ahead of the curve.The specific issue of apps that ask for permission to view friends' profiles with low security settings, has been addressed.But the problem of data is bigger than Facebook: the entire digital economy, the promise of digital advertising, is based on advertisers being able to see who is online and to know what their behaviours and preferences are, so that they can target ads.That requires a lot of data. It requires continuing to surveil people. Is this a problem that can even be fixed?It's our responsibility to make sure that customers' data are safe, and that customers know how to manage their data online. I think there's a world - and I believe our platform does this today - where we can continue to allow our customers to have the privacy and the ability to manage their own data in a way that's transparent, with complete control, but also allow advertisers to continue to send targeted messages to those customers. Not in a personally identified way, but on an aggregated basis.But there have been reports that the Custom Audiences tool you use to target ads has been vulnerable to re-identifying that anonymized data.Are you working on that?That's at the core of everything we do. We don't sell personalized data, point blank. On the anonymized side, as long as we continue to make sure that nobody has access to that personal information, that's where we want to continue to invest.A new Angus-Reid poll found that 64 per cent of Canadians surveyed said they plan to either change their privacy settings or cut down on their Facebook use because of the data issue.And a further 10 per cent said they are thinking of shutting down their Facebook accounts or suspending them. This is having an impact in Canada. Is that entirely negative? Is it maybe even healthy that people change their behavior on Facebook?That really gets to the heart of this trust component. If we can't keep our customers safe, we don't deserve to serve them.Period. So we need to make sure that we put the tools in place; we have the policies; we include tools on the platform. We have to do that. People should know how their data are being used, and we need to make sure that is far more visible on our platform.People leaving the platform are pushed to deactivate - which leaves all their data with Facebook - rather than delete their accounts altogether, which is also an option.There's a lot about the privacy settings that default to sharing information rather than not sharing, and it can feel like a lot of work to keep those settings locked down.The default to share more of your data with Facebook helps with your business model, since your customers are ultimately your advertisers. But are you giving any thought to a need to introduce a new default where things are locked down unless someone explicitly opts in?The one thing that has really struck me about Facebook coming in, is how committed the company is to transparency and user control. That has been the approach I've seen with the executive team.Recently some marketers have raised some concerns. Subway Restaurants said they are decreasing ad spend on Facebook over concerns that their ads weren't being seen; and there have been reports that Facebook more recently has had to do outreach with marketers who are worried about the data revelations. Are you hearing concerns in Canada?Over the last week, the conversation has changed. I've spoken to quite a few of our partners. While there are a lot of hard questions of late, when we describe what we're doing to improve the platform, our partners are pleased with where we're going.Regulators are starting to sit up and take notice. Here in Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is formally investigating Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data, and the House ethics committee voted to investigate as well. Mark Zuckerberg has said he's open to regulation. What do you think would be appropriate regulatory steps to address this?We welcome all of the discussions. The way Mark characterized it, it's not a matter of when but what kind of regulation - when we look at regulation, we believe there needs to be a much higher standard of transparency around ads. Some of the work we've already started to do, we're not waiting for regulation.Do you think Facebook is bad for democracy?I believe the mission of Facebook in bringing people together and engaging with community is absolutely the right thing to do. With that comes a huge amount of responsibility. We need to make sure that the platform has the protections in place to protect against that.A big competitor of yours, Google, has been vocal about its responsibility to sustaining journalism. Facebook is where a lot of people are getting their news. Have you thought about your role in the information ecosystem, the potential need to prioritize higher-quality information?We have. We have a big responsibility to make sure the sources people see are trusted sources. We've got capabilities in place to make sure that some of the content you referenced earlier is being de-prioritized or taken off the platform altogether. We've got a big commitment to that.Quality of information is one thing, but how do you fix the Facebook filter bubble, where people only hear from the community they've chosen?It is hard. The filter bubble question, I have this conversation all the time. When you think about it, the interactions you have with your friends, I can tell you my friends have a very diverse set of opinions.You are getting that mix.We're never going to get it 100 per cent right. But we need to continue to promote diversity in conversation.

In the recording, Bridges also described his own MP Maureen Pugh as \"f...... useless\", for which he later apologised. Then on Thursday, Ross released a text message exchange relating to the donation that Ross alleged came from a single businessman but the payments were broken up to avoid having to declare it.Asked about the possibility of an injunction, a spokesman for Bridges said: \"The National Party is considering its legal options.\"Victoria University associate professor, Dr Nicole Moreham said Bridges could seek an injunction and would have a strong case. If National heard the publication of material was imminent, it could apply to the court for an injunction on the basis of what it knew about the contents to stop it from being released.The only basis a person can avoid that liability was if there was a public interest in the release of the material, such as criminal offending. \"I think even on just what has been released at the moment, it's not clear there was a justification for releasing that entire conversation.\"Moreham, who specialises in privacy and confidence breaches said there may not be clear public interest to justify a recording of someone talking with political colleagues. \"I think he would have a pretty strong case in breach of confidence.\"That information could have been imparted in circumstances of confidence - shared in such a way the other person knew it was not to go any further, she said.\"If you knew those things, I think it would be pretty easy to establish in any type of conversation with a political colleague ... you could get an injunction for breach of confidence.\"The law was mindful of protecting confidential relationships and the kinds of exchanges where people can speak freely about things they do that they do not want aired publicly, she said.Moreham added that if there was a breach in confidence, it was also likely there could be a breach in privacy, depending on the contents.A lot of weight would also be put on the way the information was imparted, she said. An entrapment situation would not help the defendant because it would slightly reduce the public interest if there were questions that were led into and not voluntary or spontaneous exchanges.

On Thursday Labor MPs and senators were left reeling when a procedural blunder allowed the government's exemption to be waved through the Senate.An estimated 1500 public and multinational companies will still feature in the Tax Office report, which is due to be published this year.The government sought the exemption because it was worried about the privacy, commercial interests and personal safety of the families behind private companies.Businesses said they were worried the information would be misconstrued and used in name-and-shame campaigns by activists.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Parliament the exemption was a reasonable response to Labor's anti-business regime.\"[Labor's laws] had nothing to do with gathering tax,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"What it was calculated to do, however, was to prejudice medium-sized Australian private companies as against big multinationals and public listed companies.\"During a question time dominated by wrangling over his personal wealth, Mr Turnbull said private companies needed to be able to keep their financial affairs private when negotiating with big supermarkets, for example.Labor had planned to defer a vote until the next parliamentary sitting period in three weeks' time.But when key independents and Greens senators did not show up to speak about the bill, and Labor did not react quickly enough, the changes were passed on voices rather than going to a \"division\", which requires all senators to attend the chamber to vote.The government needs the support of six of the eight crossbenchers to get legislation passed when Labor and the Greens vote together.Because there was no division, it is unclear how they would have voted.Crossbenchers had been lobbied for months by former assistant treasurer Josh Frydenberg and representatives of beef producer Teys.Although some of the nation's highest-profile families were set to be affected, only Teys went public with its objections.Senator Nick Xenophon later told the Senate he supported the exemption, and sources said the bill would have passed even without the procedural blunder.The Greens said the Coalition had \"scratched the back of its big business mates\". Both Labor and the Greens are looking at whether there is any way to revisit the vote.Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the changes were \"rammed through\" by a Prime Minister intent on denying Australians information about big companies.\"Labor introduced these tax transparency laws in 2013 because we know that scrutiny and openness help ensure everyone pays their fair share,\" he said. \"Without transparency, dodgy dealings can flourish in the dark.\"Tax Justice Network Australia spokesman Mark Zirnsak said the outcome was \"alarming\"."}, "NYT_923": {"true_label": "01", "text": "Google faces new scrutiny in Europe on data capture;'Mistake' claim doubted after engineer reportedly said activity was intended FULL TEXTPrivacy regulators in Britain, Germany and France said Wednesday that they might reopen or expand their investigations into Google's illegal collection of personal data for its Street View service after a programmer reportedly contradicted the company's explanation that it had been done by mistake.The disclosure by Google in 2010 that it had illegally collected the data - including e-mails, photos, Web histories and passwords - from Wi-Fi routers around the world was first uncovered in Germany and led to a series of inquiries by privacy regulators in Europe and around the world.All of those reviews except two in Germany, one regulatory and one criminal, were settled after Google apologized and attributed the illegal activity to an error by the programmer.But last week in the United States, a new report on the activity by the Federal Communications Commission showed that the programmer, a Google engineer who lives in Palo Alto, California, told a superior in 2007 and 2008 that his software would also collect the personal data from unencrypted Wi-Fi routers as Street View recording vehicles passed by, and that seven engineers who worked on the code were in the position to know what was going on.The report also said the engineer had clearly spelled out his intentions in his initial proposal. Managers of the Street View project said they had never read it.In Germany, where reviews by a privacy regulator and the Hamburg State prosecutor's office are continuing, the new information will influence the course of both inquiries, said Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, whose investigation first brought Google's illegal collection of Internet data to light.''Of course this will have a big impact,'' Mr. Caspar said. ''This is apparently a totally different situation than what we thought initially. We had been told that it was a simple mistake, as the company had told us. But now, we are learning that this wasn't a mistake and that people within the company knew this information was being collected. That puts it in a totally different light.''Peter Schaar, the German federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, is also following the latest developments in the case with interest, a spokeswoman said.A spokesman in Hamburg for Google said the company would have no comment to add to remarks made last week, when the Federal Communications Commission said in its report that it had found no wrongdoing.''While we disagree with some of the statements made in the document,'' the company said, referring to the report, ''we agree with the F.C.C.'s conclusion that we did not break the law. We hope that we can now put this matter behind us.''The French privacy regulator, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, said Wednesday that it would also review the F.C.C. report and consider its options.C.N.I.L., as the French regulator is known, is leading a European review of Google's new global data privacy policy, which was announced in January and combines data collected from several Google services. C.N.I.L. is analyzing Google's responses to 69 questions that the French regulator sent the company this year.A person with knowledge of the review, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the French agency would most likely have new questions about Google's collection of Wi-Fi data.In Britain, Greg Jones, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office, said it would review the F.C.C. report to determine whether further action was warranted in Britain. In 2010, the British regulator accepted the apology from Google and asked it to destroy the data collected in Britain.''We will study the Federal Communications Commission's report and consider what further action, if any, needs to be taken,'' Mr. Jones said.The European Union's top privacy panel, the Article 29 Group, which advises the European Commission, will discuss Google's illegal collection of data as part of Street View, a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that gives users a view of the streets they are navigating, and what response to take.Jacob Kohnstamm, chairman of the European privacy panel and of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said European officials were disappointed by the revelations. Many regulators, he said, feel misled by Google, whose executives in 2010 had reassured European lawmakers, often in personal appearances, that the illegal data collection was unintentional.Mr. Kohnstamm said the new disclosures would be a topic of discussion among European regulators attending a three-day convention that begins on Wednesday in Luxembourg.''We will certainly discuss the matter,'' he said during an interview. ''My first reaction is, this is a bloody shame.''Google's global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, spoke in 2010 at a hearing in the Netherlands on the Wi-Fi taping activity, Mr. Kohnstamm said.''At this hearing, Peter Fleischer made it pretty clear in his oral statement and in writing that it was the mistake of one single guy working at Google who had made a stupid mistake,'' Mr. Kohnstamm said. ''But apparently, it wasn't a mistake at all.''Mr. Kohnstamm said that European regulators would explore legal options to make Google accountable for its actions but that their options were limited. In the case of the Netherlands, Google destroyed the Dutch data it had collected, as requested, and regulators there will not reopen the case, he said.''I am not quite sure yet what we do legally,'' he said. ''That depends on what the individual data protection authorities decide to do. But I think it is time for data protection authorities around the world to work together to hold the company accountable.''He added: ''Having told data protection authorities around the globe that the taping was a mistake, and now apparently that it was a deliberate action, is disappointing. In a political sense, that would be considered contempt of Parliament and would mean the end of the career for the person responsible.''The unauthorized collection of Internet payload data, which the Federal Communications Commission determined was not illegal in the United States, is a violation of European law, Mr. Kohnstamm said.Enforcement of privacy law in Europe is done on a national level, though a proposed revision to the European Data Protection Directive, which is not expected to be completed until 2013 at the earliest, would give national regulators the power to sanction violators up to 2 percent of annual sales. Based on Google's 2011 results, such a fine would amount to $758 million.Under existing law, European privacy regulators can levy only limited fines on global technology companies, even in egregious cases. The French regulator, C.N.I.L., fined Google (EURO)100,000, or about $131,000 at current exchange rates, for its Wi-Fi data collection in France. German law empowers the Hamburg regulator to levy fines of as much as (EURO)500,000 in cases where there is willful intent to violate the law, or (EURO)150,000 in cases of negligence.The British regulator has the power to levy a fine of as much as \u00a3500,000, or about $809,000, in cases where violations of British data protection law by a company or individual cause ''substantial'' damage and distress. But the agency must prove that those responsible knew they were breaking British law.Many European regulators that have already settled with Google will have a hard time legally reopening their cases, said Mr. Caspar, the Hamburg regulator.Even the German criminal investigation could be thwarted by jurisdictional obstacles. The Google engineer lives in the United States, possibly complicating efforts by German prosecutors to question him.

All for a chance to gain points towards a catalogue of other products that will, no doubt, give them even more information about me.Until recently, I had a stack of loyalty cards, just like most people, but, frankly, it was scary how much they gleaned about me and how often their offers hit the mark. Within a month of starting to use my Everyday FlyBuy thingamabobbie, their whirring computers zeroed in on my purchase of cat food; spam started to arrive about pet products.

But he also warned that intelligence officials have an obligation to tell the truth about surveillance in their public statements.Inman, who is also a former deputy CIA director and retired navy admiral, was an architect of the first major surveillance reform, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.In his first public comments on the Edward Snowden controversy that has engulfed the agency he ran in the 1970s, he said: \"I'm not going to make a case to you that revisiting all the terms of the Patriot Act is justified. I would be very comfortable with specific authorisation for collection and controls on how it's done. That's how we started out originally in this process.\"Let's be realistic that this is a problem that's been generated in large measure with the explosion of communications,\" Inman, 82, now a professor at the University of Texas-Austin, added. \"It's the internet, the mobile phones - the quantity of communication globally is just exponentially higher than I had to deal with in 1977-81. That's why I'm a little reluctant to sit back and second guess, not having been involved in how you went about each step in trying to deal with this reality.\"It's a different world. And does that mean it may be worthwhile going back and looking at authorisations, process issues? I would urge that if you're going to do that, look at privacy issues in the private sector, not just the government. I personally find it offensive that it's fine for X corporation to have everything on you but not the government to know. That's a basic don't-trust-your-government argument, which I think erodes democracy.\"Asked if he advocated a holistic re-evaluation of US rules governing surveillance in both the government and private sector, Inman replied: \"Yes, because you go back to update the authorisations, the procedures, based on how has the nature of communications changed.\"He argued that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is appropriate in light of a terrorist threat he considers to be mutating, and characterised critics of the surveillance as isolationists, grandstanders and hypocrites: \"I don't have a problem with the bulk collection, as long as there are rigid controls on how you can actually access what was said.\"Documents leaked by Snowden and published in the Guardian suggest that the NSA's controls are less than rigid. Among them are indications that it has the authority to search through databases of foreign emails, phone calls and associated data for names and identifying information, something Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, calls a \"backdoor search\" capability.Captions:Bobby Ray Inman, a former NSA director, urged an overhaul of surveillance law following developments on the internet"}, "TDP_256": {"true_label": "10", "text": "ACC incompetence no laughing matter B RITISH comedian Rowan Atkinson would draw a wealth of material from the ACC privacy scandal. The slapstick incompetence that resulted in thousands of clients' details being emailed to Bronwyn Pullar and the bumbling failure to investigate the breach would provide scripts for a whole series of Mr Bean.Unfortunately, ACC's cavalier attitude to privacy is no laughing matter. Personal information is its stock in trade. Each claim requires medical reports, and in the case of sexual abuse claims, it will gather highly sensitive and personal information, including mental health reports.In order for ACC to do its job properly, claimants must have faith that their personal information will be protected. The independent review of ACC's information security shows it has paid scant regard to that important duty.The review finds that the details of 6748 claimants were mistakenly sent to Ms Pullar when a senior manager corresponding with her accidentally clicked and dragged an unrelated email. That email contained a spreadsheet of the claims, which included 250 victims of sexual abuse.Ms Pullar told two senior managers about the privacy breach during a meeting to discuss her own claim on December 1. She also made 44 other allegations relating to ACC's failure to follow legislation, guidelines and codes.However, aside from an informal verbal request for the spreadsheet to be returned, and a written request a week later, ACC made no efforts to get it back or investigate what details had been sent or how. It was only when this newspaper reported the privacy breach on March 13 that ACC started to take it seriously.In an extraordinary development, ACC then claimed Ms Pullar had threatened to keep the information unless she was given a guaranteed benefit for two years. However, a recording she made of the meeting revealed no such threat was made. The police reached the same view after an investigation following a complaint from ACC.Despite ACC's hamfisted management of the issue, the report finds it has put in place measures that will help prevent further privacy breaches. Interim chairwoman Paula Rebstock has also promised that recommendations to further boost privacy protocols will be implemented.The whole saga has been symptomatic of the worrying culture that has developed at ACC, and which contributed to the departure of chairman John Judge, deputy John McCliskie, board member Rob Campbell and chief executive Ralph Stewart this year.A separate report from Auditor-General Lyn Provost, sparked by claims Ms Pullar received special treatment after making a direct approach to Mr McCliskie, further highlights the problems.Although Ms Provost finds that Ms Pullar's approach did not affect her claim, she expresses concern at the board's failure to recognise her \"wider allegations of illegality and fraud as risks to the organisation\".She did not investigate whether those allegations were justified, but notes that public entities should always take allegations that threaten public trust in them seriously.

It would also bar them from collecting or using student data to create marketing profiles.In phone interviews, Representative Jared S. Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, the bill's sponsors, said they hoped to increase trust in education technology companies.''This is a first step in providing a framework that can address the concerns of parents and educators and, at the same time, allow the promise of education technology to transform our schools,'' Mr. Polis said.But the bill is likely to be opposed by education privacy advocates who seek stronger consent mechanisms for students and parents - as well as by industry groups that favor self-regulation.''All this bill does is add additional legal hurdles for innovating educational services,'' an executive at a technology trade group wrote to associates on Friday in a private email that was forwarded to a reporter with the stipulation that the writer of the email not be identified.As school districts across the country turn to powerful new digital education tools, efforts to increase teacher and parent buy-in have been multiplying. Industry executives say that so-called adaptive learning products seem particularly promising. These are apps and sites that can collect and analyze a wealth of student information with the idea of tailoring lessons on the spot to the abilities of each child.''The world of big data has hit the classroom,'' Mr. Messer said. ''We want to preserve the positive benefits the technology can bring to student outcomes.''Some parents have started warning, however, that school districts lack the resources to monitor how technology vendors use and secure their children's records.These parents say they're troubled by the risks as varied as data breaches and identity theft to the possibility of companies sharing sensitive details like students' grades, disciplinary actions or health data with college or job recruiters.Although there is a federal education privacy law that requires schools to maintain control over students' educational records, critics say it has not kept pace with the practices of educational technology companies.''As a parent, I'm concerned that there are vast amounts of academic, physical and behavioral information being acquired on children that could have negative implications for our children's future,'' said Anna Shah-Bomba, a mother of an elementary school student and a college student in Poughkeepsie, N.Y."}, "TG_4250": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Police and firms to access patients' records: Fears for privacy of new integrated database: Move 'threatens patient-doctor confidentiality' A report (Police and firms to access patients' records, 7 February, page 4) referred to a \"database that will store the entire nation's health records\".

Now the two sides are struggling to bridge the divide.In the United States, Congress has enacted a patchwork of privacy laws that separately limit the use of certain sensitive records, like medical documents and credit reports. The European Union has instituted a common directive that gives its citizens certain fundamental rights - like the right to obtain copies of records held about them by companies and institutions - that are absent in the United States.Even so, U.S. officials maintain that the divergent approaches are equal. ''The sum of the parts of U.S. privacy protection is equal to or greater than the single whole of Europe,'' said Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel of the Department of Commerce in Washington. He is overseeing an agency effort to help develop codes of conduct for industry groups, like app developers, whose collection and use of consumer data are now unregulated.Europe begs to differ.''Yes, we share the basic idea of privacy,'' said Peter Hustinx, the European data protection supervisor. ''But there is a huge deficit on the U.S. side.''And the data-control divide appears to be widening.A year ago, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive overhaul to strengthen online privacy rights - changes that could have big repercussions for U.S. technology companies and marketers that operate in the European Union. U.S. officials, trade groups and technology executives have responded by making frequent visits to Brussels and other cities, where they have urged regulators and legislators to reconsider the one-regulation-fits-all-data approach.What is at stake, U.S. industry representatives say, is nothing less than a free and commerce-friendly Internet.''The ecosystem of the Internet is very delicate,'' said Kevin Richards, senior vice president for U.S. government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents companies like Google and Microsoft.''It's not wise to have an overly broad, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach that would hinder or undermine the ability of companies to innovate in a global economy,'' he said.E.U. members already have data protection laws in place, based on a directive from 1995 that laid out principles for the collection of personal information. The proposed new rules would strengthen some existing provisions, standardize data protections across the 27 member states of the Union, and provide some new rights, like ''data portability'' - the right of consumers to easily transfer their text files, photographs and videos from one social network, e-mail system or cloud storage service to another. And they would subject companies that violate the rules to penalties of up to 2 percent of their annual global revenue.Asked for comment, Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the architect of the proposed regulation, said in a statement: ''The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update.'' She continued: ''That is why I have proposed a root-and-branch reform of the E.U.'s data protection rules - currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. - that will both protect citizens' rights and facilitate business in the digital age.''But some provisions seem too rigid to U.S. officials and trade groups.They argue that the U.S. approach, which includes sector-specific privacy laws, in addition to industry self-regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, is more nimble.''We hope that Europe will move in the direction of those multistakeholder standards, and not standards which are not flexible and don't move at Internet speed,'' said Mr. Kerry, who has traveled to Europe four times over the past year to discuss these issues.From the perspective of some European legislators, however, U.S. representatives appear more interested in protecting commerce than consumers.The U.S. effort may have backfired, they say, pushing some European officials toward even broader measures.Last month, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German representative in the European Parliament who reviewed the draft regulation, proposed additional rights for citizens - like the right not to be subject to consumer profiling.''My impression is that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Commerce Department are mostly just following the interests of Silicon Valley,'' he said. ''This leads to heavy pressure on the European regulator.''But Mr. Kerry said the United States had to make its views known if the systems were to work in concert.''I know that some people have raised eyebrows at our involvement; I make no apologies,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''We in the United States and countries and businesses around the world are stakeholders in this process. This has an important impact on the global economy.''The solution to this trans-Atlantic clash may simply be U.S. ingenuity.Last year, President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights for consumers that would give Americans many of the same baseline protections that the draft European rule proposes to reinforce. These include the right of access to records that companies hold about them, the right to correct those records and the right to have limits on the personal data that companies collect and keep. Officials in Washington said they would work with Congress on legislation protecting those rights and to extend oversight to industries not currently covered by U.S. privacy laws.A coalition of more than a dozen U.S. advocacy groups said it would send a letter on Monday to senior officials in the Obama administration seeking a meeting to ensure that U.S. policy makers' efforts in Europe ''are not averse to the views expressed by the president.''

That was one of the challenges presented during a panel at SXSW on Friday, featuring privacy activist Cory Doctorow, the FBI's Christopher Piehota and Brian Brackeen, founder of facial recognition company Kairos. The panel's title asked their central question: Are Biometrics the New Face of Surveillance? Related:  SXSW 2017: your guide to the best music, films and TVAs biometric technology becomes more sophisticated, governments and private companies have been building tools for identifying people using their faces, voices, irises and other unique signatures. But there is little oversight of these systems, leaving them open to misuse.\"We are not comfortable with the lack of regulation,\" said Brackeen, whose company helps movie studios and ad agencies study emotional responses to their content. Kairos also provides facial recognition to Disney theme parks and cruises to let people find and buy photos of themselves. He said that his facial recognition system is now so good at recognising races, a challenge in the past, that it can be used as a genealogy tool. \"It's coming back with the percentages of race the person is,\" he said, mentioning someone who came up 12% Asian despite looking Caucasian. \"Oh, I have a Chinese grandmother,\" she said, according to Brackeen.Brackeen said Kairos has been pushing for regulation, and that although he believes Karios' conduct is responsible, he could not say the same for some competitors. He mentioned FindFace, for example, the Russian company which made an app that could analyze images of people and match it to their social media accounts. The app was supposed to be for finding friends, but members of online messaging board Dvach started using it to expose identities, harass porn actors and spam their families with the news of their discovery. \"That's wildly offensive to us, but it's happening,\" Brackeen said. \"That's why we need regulations. Not everyone will have the moral compass we have.\"In the government sector, the FBI has access to a database with almost half a billion images that it uses for identification purposes. Some of those are photos collected from criminal or law enforcement purposes, but others come from companies that do background checks for jobs. The FBI also has access to the state department passport and visa databases, which can be cross-referenced with photos of criminal suspects.Doctorow said there needed to be far more public information in how and when these databases are being used. \"It's great that you are using photos of missing and exploited children to find them, but are they also retained for law enforcement purposes? We can't know unless there's transparency.\"Doctorow referred to a report by the Government Accountability Office that came to the same conclusion, and recommended several measures to better inform citizens and protect privacy.The FBI's Piehota acknowledged , \"there were some things not handled as well as they could have been,\" but argued that the issue was also partly a matter of education. Over time, he said, people have become \"pretty comfortable\" with having their fingerprints taken.\"My goal is to increase transparency and confidence so people understand why we do it.\""}, "TDP_1817": {"true_label": "10", "text": "Royals awarded damages over topless photos FRANCE: A French court has ruled that photographers and gossip magazine executives violated the privacy of Britain's Duchess of Cambridge by taking and publishing photographs of the former Kate Middleton sunbathing topless.The court in a Paris suburb yesterday fined two executives of French gossip magazine Closer - owner Ernesto Mauri and executive editor Laurence Pieau - the maximum of [Euro]45,000 (NZ$74,000) each for such an offence.The executives, along with two photographers for a celebrity photo agency, were collectively ordered to pay [Euro]50,000 (NZ$82,000) in damages to the duchess and the same amount to her husband, Prince William.The award was substantially below the figure the magazine's lawyer said the royals had requested, but the timing of the court's finding of privacy invasion has particular resonance in Britain.Last week marked the 20th anniversary of the death of William's mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a Paris car accident while being pursued by paparazzi.The royal couple's office at Kensington Palace said they were pleased the court had ruled in their favour, and they now considered the matter closed.Kate and William \"wished to make the point strongly that this kind of unjustified intrusion should not happen\", the palace said in a statement.The pictures of the duchess were taken in September 2012 with telephoto lenses while the couple were on a patio at a private estate in France's southern Provence region. Their publication in Closer and a French regional newspaper outraged the royal family.Using lists of hotel customers and cellphone data, investigators found that photographers Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides were in the vicinity of the castle. Surges in their incomes were also recorded after the photos appeared in Closer.Moreau and Jacovides, who work for Paris-based celebrity photo agency Bestimage, denied taking the most contentious pictures published in Closer. They each were fined [Euro]10,000 (NZ$16,500), but the court suspended half of their penalties.Jean Veil, the lawyer for the royal couple, did not disclose how much in damages he had sought on their behalf. Closer's lawyer Paul- Albert Iweins said they had requested damages worth [Euro]1.6 million.Iweins called the fines the court imposed \"a bit exaggerated,\" but said he was pleased that the damages awarded were in line with similar French cases of privacy invasion. - AP--------------------CAPTION:The Duchess of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, have had their invasion of privacy complaint upheld by a French court.Picture: REUTERS"}, "USA_1617": {"true_label": "10", "text": "200 imprisoned after illegal cellphone tracking Lawyers in Baltimore identified as many as 200 people who were sent to prison based on evidence police gathered with the help of a powerful cellphone tracking tool that a state court has ruled was used illegally.The ruling, issued Wednesday by Maryland's second-highest court, said Baltimore police violated the Constitution when they used one of the tracking devices to catch a shooting suspect without first obtaining a search warrant. It was the first time an appeals court weighed in directly on the legality of phone-trackers that have been widely  used by police for nearly a decade.\"Cellphone users have an objectively reasonable expectation that their cellphones will not be used as real-time tracking devices, through the direct and active interference of law enforcement,\" a panel of three judges on Maryland's Court of Special Appeals wrote. The judges accused Baltimore detectives of misleading the lower-court judge who approved their use of the device, commonly known as a stingray.That decision could imperil hundreds of criminal convictions across Maryland, where police have used stingrays prolifically. An investigation last year by USA TODAY identified nearly 2,000 cases in Baltimore alone in which the police secretly used stingrays to make arrests for everything from murder to petty thefts, typically without a search warrant.\"We have a grave concern that our clients are incarcerated because of the use of a stingray that was illegal,\" said Natalie Finegar, who is reviewing stingray cases for the city's public defender.Finegar said defense lawyers are focused most urgently on about 200 cases in which people appear to have been sent to prison based on evidence the police found after they used a stingray. \"Those are the emergencies,\" she said. \"By itself, it's just a huge number of cases.\"Stingrays are suitcase-sized devices that allow the police to pinpoint a cellphone's location to within a few yards by posing as a cell tower. They have drawn alarm from privacy advocates, in part because they can intercept information from the phones of nearly everyone  nearby.Dozens of police departments  own stingrays, but few have revealed when or how they use them. The U.S. Justice Department ordered federal agents last year to obtain search warrants before using stingrays.Maryland prosecutors can appeal to the state's highest court.

She couldn't be found.\"It's Cooper's job to decide whether Gloucestershire police should ask telephone and internet companies for customer records that, in this case, could save a life. Requests from any officer in the force must be channelled through a small team at headquarters known as the single point of contact (Spoc). If a designated person, usually a superintendent, believes the interference with personal privacy is necessary and proportionate to the objective specified by the requesting officer, then the Spoc team will ask the communications company for so-called comms data - such as the location of a phone.\"It's not like the movies,\" a sergeant explained. \"You don't see a red dot flashing on a street map. We could be told that the phone is anywhere in an area measuring a kilometre or two across.\" But it's a start, especially if the location is anywhere near the Clifton suspension bridge. On this occasion, the girl was found and her life was not in danger.The police can obtain comms data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, known as Ripa. Such data may provide details of where, when and for how long a phone or a computer has been used but not the contents of a phone or email.It's a sensitive issue. Last month, the Commons home affairs committee criticised the Metropolitan and Kent police forces for obtaining journalists' phone records. The committee, chaired by Keith Vaz MP, concluded that Ripa was \"not fit for purpose, with law enforcement agencies failing to routinely record the professions of individuals who have had their communications data accessed\".Detectives in Gloucestershire accept that intrusive powers should be used no more than necessary. But they do not think these tools should be confined to serious cases. \"If someone has stolen your bike and you see it advertised online with a mobile number to call, you expect us to find it,\" one said.Senior officers believe ethical problems arising from their powers to access comms data are likely to become more acute as we rely ever more on electronic communication. Forgot to switch on your slow-cooker when you left home this morning? No problem: just message it from your phone and tell it to let you know when dinner's ready. But what happens when someone hacks into the video camera in your children's bedroom? Or detectives come across pictures of you punching your spouse?So chief police officers have told me that they plan to draft a new code of conduct, with a board of ethics to administer it. It would be similar in some ways to the Medical Research Council's ethics, regulation and public involvement committee. Officers want to consult widely on what the code should contain. The board of ethics could assess individual cases and update the code in the light of experience.Richard Berry, Gloucestershire's assistant chief constable, is the national policing lead for comms data - at least until the chief officers' association, Acpo, is replaced by the national police chiefs' council on 1 April. To explain why the police need a comms data code, Berry told me about a case his force is investigating.Detectives became aware of mass access to child abuse imagery. Illegal material had been stored on the servers of an organisation without its knowledge, from which it could presumably be downloaded by anyone who knew where to look.Investigators found the images had been accessed from 330,000 confirmed IP addresses around the world, of which about 27,000 were traced to the UK. Using the comms data they had obtained under RipaA powers, Gloucestershire police located some of those IP addresses and executed search warrants at people's homes. They seized computer equipment for examination.To their surprise, detectives found no illegal images had been downloaded to individual computers. The IP addresses belonged not to the computers but to routers - the hub in your home that connects your device to the internet - which had been hacked using what a botnet. So the suspected offenders whose computers had been seized were entirely innocent.The assistant chief constable sees this an example of the challenges facing police in an increasingly digitised society. \"We could have been more proactive and heavy handed,\" Berry said. I take that to mean his officers could have arrested a large number of suspects in the full glare of publicity. Instead, through a series of \"slow and tortuous\" requests to police forces in other countries, they are trying to find out who uploaded the illegal material and what the criminals planned to do with it.Berry wants to rewrite the Peelian principles - associated with Sir Robert Peel and summarised as policing by consent - in a way that meets the needs of the digital age. Peel, who established the first modern police force in London in 1829, recognised that physical force should be used as a last resort. Berry suggests there is a need to consider how the police might limit electronic intrusion in the same way.Surely a code of ethics will make the job of the police more difficult, limiting their room for manoeuvre? On the contrary, Berry argued, without greater transparency there would inevitably be further complaints about officers' behaviour. \"We would potentially be judged by society as being unethical,\" he said, \"even though we would have been acting within the law.\"In Berry's view, \"the British model of policing by consent means engaging with communities, adherence to proportionality, and creating a new sense of legitimacy\". That meant the police should take the lead in marking the boundaries of the law.There is likely to be widespread support for the idea of a digital code of ethics.

A journalist, Patrick Cain, is seeking information about the number of registered sex offenders who live in particular communities. Ontario is strongly opposed, arguing that vigilantes will hunt down sex predators, and the offenders will stop reporting in to police.  \"Offenders fear the public more than they fear the police,\" Ontario's Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Service and Social Services says, in a document filed with the Supreme Court. It says that offenders trust the police to protect their confidentiality, and that the court should give the government \"a margin of appreciation,\" without asking for proof that vigilantism would occur.  Thursday's hearing comes as the Conservative government is set to introduce the Tougher Sentences for Child Predators Act, which would let the public view some information on high-risk child predators in a federal registry - but only those whom police have warned the public about. (Those warnings include the names of communities, but not specific addresses.) The limited openness in dispute at the Supreme Court would be a far cry from the huge amounts of information on tap in the United States, in which interactive maps featuring names, pictures and Google street views are available in many jurisdictions, and e-mail alerts can be requested when new offenders move into neighbourhoods.  \"It makes life very difficult - they can be shunned, they can lose their job, they can lose their housing,\" said James Jacobs, who specializes in criminal law and procedures at New York University School of Law. On the other hand, \"a person would like to know who's living next door, and who is inviting their kids over for lemonade.\"  Mr. Cain is seeking information on the numbers of offenders in postal code areas (first three characters only). An average of nearly 25,000 people live in each area - but the smallest area has 400. Ontario's registry covers a wide range of sex offences, from exposure to rape at gunpoint. Ontario argues that the data could be used to help identify names of offenders in some communities, \"if it is connected with other publicly available information about convicted sex offenders.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Ann Cavoukian, the province's Information and Privacy Commissioner, said in an interview. She supports the release of the information, arguing that without names or other identifying information, there is no privacy issue. \"Their identities aren't going to be revealed. It's just a bulk number.\"  Someone might wish to check a neighbourhood, she said, to learn how many registered sex offenders live there before moving in - though she also said she couldn't imagine that anyone would do such a thing.  She said the Ontario government may see the request as a slippery slope to a free-for-all of information.  Canada Family Action, a Calgary group, oversees a website called StopPedophiles.ca that publishes names and photos of child sex offenders when they are in the news.  \"I think that's a start,\" Brian Rushfeldt, the group's president, said of making public the number of registered offenders in a community. \"If you know they're in your postal code area, you know they're in your neighbourhood. I don't think most people have that information at all.\"  He leans away from the U.S. approach of making addresses public, however, fearing that it would lead to vigilantism.

Now the Supreme Court will decide if it's OK for police to find out as well -- without a warrant.The justices agreed Monday to hear what will be the latest in a string of cases testing the clash of technology and privacy.The challenge comes from a man convicted of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio, for whom police accessed 127 days of cellphone records, revealing 12,898 points of location data. The suspect, Timothy Carpenter, was convicted and then lost a 2-1 federal appeals court ruling in which he argued that police should have sought a warrant.\"Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause,\" said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Nathan Freed Wessler. \"The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the longstanding protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records.\"Police conducting criminal investigations routinely get court orders to obtain records from cellphone service providers showing where suspects have traveled, based on which cell towers they used.Federal appeals courts have agreed in recent years that the data is not protected under the Fourth Amendment because customers already provide the information to the companies.The high court has shown a keen interest in privacy rights when it comes to modern technology. In 2014, the justices ruled unanimously that police usually need a search warrant to prowl through a smartphone's contents. In 2012, they ruled that police cannot track suspects by placing GPS tracking devices on their vehicles. In prior decades, the court also ruled that warrants are required to use devices ranging from an electronic beeper to a thermal imaging device in order to gain private information.But when it comes to cellphone location data, lower courts generally have cited a Supreme Court case from 1979 that held there is no right to privacy when information has been voluntarily turned over to a third party. In that case, it was the phone numbers dialed from a private home. In the current case, it's the location data automatically collected from cell towers.The federal government contends that customers' approximate locations enable police to link them to the time and place of crimes under investigation, but without the  information that would come from  details contained inside peoples' cellphones.\"Petitioner lacks any subjective expectation of privacy in phone-company records of historical cell-site data because they are business records that MetroPCS and Sprint create for their own purposes,\" the Justice Department argued in court papers.

Member details were subsequently passed onto Lis-Con itself.Cbus employees may have been trying to help recover unpaid super contributions from Lis-Con on behalf of members, but CMC was not a sponsoring body of the super fund and it is arguable the firm should never have been given such information.Even if the leak of personal information has not ruffled feathers among some of the more strident members of Cbus, unitholders with more moderate views, as well as those who are even vaguely concerned with privacy issues, might take a different view.So might members of the fund who are not members of the CMFEU.Merger implicationsBut the challenges are much bigger and broader than that. Mr Bracks also has to consider the impact this scandal could have on the willingness of savers to join the scheme in the future, as well as the willingness of other funds to consider merging with Cbus in an environment where scale will become increasingly important.Indeed, the CFMEU is becoming something of a milestone around the chairman's neck.Just two years ago the construction union invited rival retirement schemes to apply to become the default fund for tradies as part of another industrial dispute, on that occasion with Grocon, a developer.These debacles hardly give comfort to retirement funds looking for a tie-up.Then there is the issue of the fund's trustees.As a general rule it is perhaps unfair to accuse someone of lacking the appropriate ethics and standards to perform a particular role by virtue of association, but in the case of Cbus we are talking about a group of union officials who sit on the fund's board, who are presumably well acquainted with other senior union officials not on the board and who appear to have a wide range of ethics and motives.A chairman of a listed financial services company, no doubt under pressure from shareholders, would be asking some hard questions about just how fit and proper directors with awkward associations are to fulfil their duties.They might/would/should be asking those directors to explain why they should be allowed to remain on the board.Mr Bracks should also be wondering that if there were more independent directors on his board, there may have been more questions asked at board level about the relationship between the fund and the union and about the fund's privacy policy, and greater efforts made to discover what happened to members' personal information - rather than have it come out in the royal commission.In addition to pulling Rita Mallia, Frank O'Grady and David Noonan - the three CFMEU representatives on the Cbus board - aside, Mr Bracks should look at the mechanisms by which Cbus is allowed to recover super contributions that are in arrears from employers.Currently the fund can chase unpaid contributions either by going directly to the recalcitrant employers, or through the unions.If the fund limited this to going to employers alone, it would not need to divulge member details to external parties."}}
