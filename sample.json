{"AFR_1003": "Changes made by the Abbott government in primary care will stop short of allowing private insurers to cover out-of-pocket GP fees, and most likely be limited to a form of information sharing.Trials being undertaken by Medibank Private in Queensland, where the insurer has cut a deal with a chain of GP clinics to cover some administrative costs in return for their customers avoiding a so-called \"gap\" fee, is not being considered by the government as a preferred model. There are concerns that if such a model were rolled out nationwide it could lead to a divided healthcare system, where privately covered patients are treated differently to those on Medicare.According to senior government sources, any changes made are not likely to require an amendment to the Private Health Insurance Act that prevents insurers from covering services such as GP visits that are already eligible for Medicare rebates.Health Minister Peter Dutton told a private health conference on Monday he wanted to be careful that any changes did not detract from Medicare.\"We have no interest in supporting changes that would result in higher premiums and therefore bring pressure to bear in other parts of the network,\" Mr Dutton said. \"Sharing information about the patient with all the usual safeguards has the potential to free up capacity for non-insured patients - not detract from it.\"The chairman of the Australian Medical Association's council of general practice, Brian Morton, said there would be some privacy concerns about sharing patient information with private health insurers, but workable arrangements could be made with the correct controls. \"The patient would have to give permission for contact with the private health insurer. There would have to be consent,\" Dr Morton said.\"It would be based on the present arrangements of access to another specialist via GP referral. It would be the same process, otherwise we're looking at sort of managed care, looking at the funds dictating the treatment and the access to other treatments. That's just not right.\"Dr Morton said he could foresee a situation where private health insurers work with GPs to find appropriate clinicians for chronically ill patients which the fund could then pay for.But it was important private health insurers did not dictate patient choice.\"We're keen to interact with the private health insurers but it's a new area and it needs to be done very carefully,\" Dr Morton said.Government-owned health insurer Medibank Private has been the most vocal in the sector pushing for change.It is set to expand its Queensland trial from six clinics to a further 30 across the state in the next month. Medibank managing director George Savvides recently argued that the current funding model for GPs resulted in \"random care\" for patients, and there was a case for better coordination between insurers and GPs for the chronically ill.", "AFR_1031": "Clever planning can help you create a clutter-free office zone without the need to sacrifice an entire room, writes Stephen Crafti.A study, with wall-to-wall bookshelves, is something most people aspire to. But increasingly, time is spent in a nook, often adjacent to a kitchen or living area. A fraction of the size, it's the place where bills are paid, as well as catching up on paper work. \"It's the type of space you can even find in a pantry, but it's used for the day to day running of the house,\" says architect Andrew Piva, a director of b.e.Architecture. \"Unlike a separate study, it's usually forms part of the living areas,\" he adds.This workstation/nook formed part of a renovation in a Victorian house in South Yarra, Melbourne. The freestanding home was reworked with the addition of a new kitchen and meals area. One of the original rooms, once used as a bedroom, was 'carved up'. One portion of this room was given over to an ensuite bathroom for the main bedroom. The other portion was transformed ito a study nook. Only four metres long by two metres wide, this space features a floor to ceiling window overlooking a pond. \"It's quite a dark and moody space,\" says Piva, pointing out the dark charcoal painted walls and the chocolate coloured laminate built-in joinery. Sufficient space for two chairs, the galley-style workstation includes built-in cupboards for storage of files.\"As the owner only worked from home one day a week, he was quite content to have a small space, which could be closed off,\" says Piva. \"There wasn't any need to sacrifice an entire room. And if needed, there's also the kitchen table to accommodate larger projects,\" he adds.Utz Sanby Architects regularly include workstations in both new homes, as well as renovations. For a house in Newport, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, Utz Sanby included a workstation for a couple, who regularly have their extended family stay. Located adjacent to the kitchen and living areas, this room, with built-in desk, also doubles as a guest bedroom. As well as a desk, there are cupboards and a chaise. \"It's usually set up as a sitting room, but it morphs ito several functions, predominantly to catch up on paperwork,\" says architect Kristin Utz, co-director of the practice.Utz Sanby used polyurethane joinery (MDF) for the desk and cupboards, edging the desk in timber. And while there's abundant light entering this room, there's also desk lighting to ensure the space can be used at night.\"We wanted to make sure this space felt part of the living areas,\" says Utz, who included glass sliding doors from the study through to the courtyard, which separates the living room. \"You want to feel connected to the family, even though you also need some privacy,\" says Utz.While this workstation occupies a separate area within the Newport home, Utz Sanby Architects often include this function in the kitchen, or immediately adjacent. \"All you really need is sufficient space to place your lap top and somewhere to charge your phone,\" says Utz, who often includes a magnetised board to scribble lists or a pin-board. And to ensure clutter is out of sight when guests come around, doors are 'pocket-hinged', allowing them to close completely.Architect Jon King, director of Design King Company, included a workstation in his own home in Randwick, Sydney. The semi-detached federation home was renovated, including a new kitchen and living area. Adjacent to the kitchen, the bench height of the workstation is the same height as the kitchen bench, both 900 millimetres high. This allows King to simply move the kitchen stool ito the workstation. \"It (workstation) was designed so you can use it with a stool, or simply standing,\" says King. \"It's not the type of space you tend to use for hours,\" he adds.King includes workstations in most residential projects, be they small or large. \"They're the type of spaces that are not given a particular name,\" says King, who uses his nook from everything to store files, to containing school files for his children. \"People want a place where they can put all their mail. That means the kitchen or dining table can remain free of clutter,\" adds King.", "AFR_1062": "The NSW government will allow consumers to use mobile applications such as Uber, goCatch and ingogo to book taxis for the first time under proposed changes to the state's taxi laws.The state government said it would also limit the surcharge on credit and debit card payments for taxis to 5 per cent, following a similar decision by the Victorian government last year, effectively halving the fee charged by incumbent Cabcharge and rivals.State Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian said changes to passenger transport laws to be introduced in state Parliament this year would remove the legal grey area which third-party booking apps have been operating under to date. \"We have already seen how real-time information on mobile phone apps has completely changed the customer experience on other modes of public transport, and it is time to modernise this out-dated taxi-booking process,\" she said in a statement. \"The reforms will safeguard customers by ensuring the apps meet the full range of customer service, privacy and safety standards that apply to existing booking services provided by taxi networks.\"By removing restrictions on competing taxi networks in the legislation, the state government will effectively give the green light to the operations of goCatch, Uber and ingogo, provided drivers are licensed and taxi meters are used. The apps will risk losing their authorisation to operate in NSW if they fail to meet the regulations.Incumbent taxi booking networks and payment operators like Cabcharge have lobbied against the third-party apps, claiming they are unsafe for passengers. \"It's something that, clearly in principle we welcome, on the basis that whatever is implemented in terms of new legislation - and we've yet to see that detail - is applied equally to all members of the industry,\" said Taxi Council of NSW chief executive, Roy Wakelin-King.But the state government is hoping the reforms will remove restrictions on the apps and encourage more taxi booking services and promote competition. \"It's not going to create an extra burden on us - it's going to help our business, it will give us a lot more credibility on the public side,\" ingogo chief executive Hamish Petrie told The Australian Financial Review. \"We're not just the crazy app we were two years ago - we're being validated by government.\"He said the government should update regulations to incentivise taxi drivers to provide better customer service. GoCatch co-founder Andrew Campbell said it would be business as usual.The reduction in surcharges will affect goCatch and Ingogo, which both currently charge in excess of 5 per cent in NSW for taxi rides booked through their apps. Both companies said they would begin reducing the surcharge in the coming weeks.Cabcharge told the market the surcharge reduction would halve the $28 million in fees it collects annually in NSW.Key points Taxi-booking apps will be allowed providing they meet regulations.

Labor senator Doug Cameron has asked the Attorney-General's Department to look into whether the practice of electronically scanning Gmail users' correspondence in order to push advertising breached bugging laws.On Friday, Senator Cameron used a Senate inquiry into online privacy protections to ask for the legal opinion which, if the practice turns out to be illegal, could have serious consequences for Google's operations.\"If you post a letter, you would expect that to be private and not opened unless there was a police investigation,\" he said.He expressed surprise at the extent of Google's data digging.At issue was whether the email scanning software that Google used to extract data in order to target ads on Gmail in effect reads communications, which could be a violation of wiretapping laws.Greens senator Scott Ludlam used the inquiry to raise the issue with Google executives when they appeared before the Senate committee on Friday morning, labelling the scanning practice \"a little bit creepy\".Google representatives stood by the company's record in defending the privacy rights of its users, and said it would only divulge the content of emails to law enforcement agencies when legally obliged to do so.But Senator Cameron was unconvinced. \"You're not allowed to fish for law enforcement purposes, but you can actually fish for profit and fish for people who are paying you?\"These latest questions over the legality of Google's data harvesting follow an ongoing Australian Federal Police investigation into the search engine company's potentially criminal collection of private network data from homes and businesses using its Street View vehicles.Google initially argued that the incident was an accident and only collected fragments of data. But it has subsequently admitted that it collected entire passwords, emails and website addresses.On Friday morning the Senate inquiry heard from Google Australia's head of public policy and government affairs, Iarla Flynn, who admitted the vehicles had deliberately scanned for the local network information as they travelled throughout Australian suburbs.Mr Flynn said that the intention had been to better determine locations and give the images greater context. Sensitive, private information had not been the target of the exercise and that once the mistake had been discovered, all Street View vehicles had been removed from operation, he said.The director of consultancy Surete Group and former head of the AFP's high-tech crime centre, Alastair MacGibbon, has asked why the AFP investigation into Google has taken so long - and why its results were not put before Friday's inquiry.\"I wonder why we were talking about this in May and we are about to hit November and the AFP still doesn't know whether there was an offence,\" he said.\"Who was it that knew? Who did it? When did they know about?\"Mr MacGibbon said that the Google executives should have instead faced questions based on the results of the official police inquiry.KEY POINTS Google scans its Gmail users' messages for advertising purposes.

The first is that I won't bother sending Christmas cards. The second is that I'll attend all the end-of-year parties I'm invited to. The third is that, next year, I'll buy presents throughout so as to avoid a mad panic in December.Each year, without fail, I break these pledges. My Australia Post pledge is the first to fall, typically after I receive my third or fourth card from friends in far away places; or friends in close places who, due to the hectic nature of everyone's lives, I rarely get to see. The least I can do is reconnect with loved ones through an end-of-year greeting, I think as I stand, self-flagellating, in an endless queue to buy stamps and cards.The parties pledge usually breaks about mid-December, when the frazzle of a full year's work and the need to get a heap done before everyone goes on annual leave has me dreaming not of Christmas cocktails but of the holiday on the other side. Just. Let. Me. Get. There.And the presents pledge? I comfort myself with the knowledge that, while many have similar ambitions, few are organised enough to pull them off. If they were, Westfield malls nationwide would not be so hectic at this time of year.That they are hectic is good news for the Lowy family, which has built a network of shopping centres across Australasia and further afield. At a time when online is disrupting bricks and mortar retailing it's fascinating to see Westfield malls going more upmarket, and technology being developed to make the physical experience more efficient and enjoyable for shoppers. More of an experience, less of a transaction.It is Steven Lowy, the youngest son, who will have to grapple with all this in the coming decade, as the only family member likely to remain in an executive role in the listed Westfield empire. The Lowys guard their privacy carefully but in a rare extended interview, Steven talks candidly to Jemima Whyte about what it was like to grow up a Lowy, what his home town needs more of and how he plans to run a company with $11.4 billion worth of offshore developments from Sydney.

At a British cafe, visitors can receive a free magazine once they step inside.And at TAFE SA's newly opened Tonsley Park campus in Adelaide's south, staff can manipulate the lighting and sound of each classroom from a mobile app that adapts to their location on-site.The word iBeacon didn't exist in the public lexicon before it appeared as an addendum to one of Apple's anticipated announcements last June, but it has since sparked feverish development from engineers and companies chasing Apple's promise of changing how we interact with physical objects with little more than a smartphone and app.Based on the same Bluetooth technology found in almost all mobile phones globally, iBeacons - or simply \"beacons\" for those wary of Apple's closed garden - allows phones to communicate with small transmitters that can determine where a person is physically and how close they are to a product or other users.Apple's own strategy for the technology remains unclear and its test roll-out at retail stores has been an annoyance or simply broken for some who have tried it.However, third-party developers are beginning to build and manipulate iBeacons for their own purpose, with little to no direction from Cupertino.\"Say you just walk into the office and your computer switches on - these are really simple ways to enhance and make the stuff you do in your life more seamless,\" suggests Daniel Nolan, co-founder and engineering lead at Sydney start-up Proxima.For the past four months, Nolan and his business partner, Sebastian Pedavoli, have been working on ways to harness iBeacons in retail stores and at major events, including the roll-out of the transmitters at 208 classrooms on TAFE SA's Tonsley Park campus.The technology, Nolan says, will allow companies to easily push information or grab data from willing customers depending on their location. A beacon-fuelled venture through an art gallery could revolutionise self-guided tours, while installing the beacons on planes or in a cinema could make it easier to serve customers or find a seat.These iBeacons also hold the promise of allowing smartphone holders to pay for physical products without a wallet or phone ever exiting their pocket - a use case Apple is reportedly working on.\"Apple is a tastemaker for this stuff,\" Nolan says. \"Apple included this technology in its flagship mobile operating system, which has 350 million users.\"Rival technology already in placeHis company has enabled the technology to work on some Android phones.But critics question whether the technology has come too late for an industry that has spent the past decade developing a rival technology - near-field communication. Now embedded in almost every new flagship smartphone running Google's Android operating system, NFC promises many of the same opportunities offered by beacons. A user must physically tap their phone against a terminal, a move which its proponents suggest would reduce any privacy concerns.The technology, which has undergone dozens of aborted trials in Australia alone in recent years, is now set to gain traction in 2014 as major banks and blue-chip companies adopt the technology for everything from payments to advertising.\"It's a chicken-and-egg problem,\" says Andrew Davis of Tapit. The Sydney company has embedded NFC chips in ads for Google, Telstra, Samsung and, more recently, major beer brands Hahn and Stella Artois. \"The great thing now is that everyone except the fruit phone has come on board with NFC-capable handsets.\"Apple's refusal to adopt NFC - which Nolan says is because of the technology's power-hungry nature - has sparked as much criticism as it has questions. In October, Commonwealth Bank chief information officer Michael Harte accused the company of attempting to \"rule their own world\", forcing the bank to create its own half-house solution to enable mobile payments on the iPhone.\"NFC is already there, and it's taken 10 years to get the standards in place - all these big organisations are comfortable where the technology is,\" says Davis. \"Beacons came out five minutes ago; it's got to go through all of that again. It's not going to happen overnight and by then, the innovation will have moved on.\"Nolan admits the big retailers such as Coles and Woolworths are unlikely to supplant the millions already spent to roll out upgraded point of sales terminals.\"People inherently don't trust software,\" he says. \"That's the big challenge - getting over the blatant distrust of humans in technology. That's always going to be there, but as the stuff becomes more normalised, when we have more of this technology around our lives, it's going to be interesting to see how this stuff plays out in 10 to 15 years.\"", "AFR_1063": "Governments around the world will consider a plan to force financial institutions to reveal more information about non-residents who have hidden money from tax authorities.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Thursday proposed a global road map for the automatic exchange of information.One of the OECD's objectives for next week's Group of 20 finance ministers in Sydney is to reduce bank secrecy and other confidentiality laws that have led to tax havens emerging in places such as Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands and Liechtenstein.The OECD suggests a new minimum standard for all governments to adopt by next year. Accounts with any type of financial institution would immediately be reported to the account holder's home country. The OECD calls for better access to information held by banks and other institutions about \"non-residents\", including income, gains and assets such as property held by individuals, corporations, and trusts.Questions remain over how to protect the privacy of that information. The OECD raised the possibility of errors in reporting, and suggested \"a robust set of due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions\".No global authority has been able to put an exact figure on the amount of money held in tax havens. In 2007, the OECD estimated capital held offshore amounted to between $US5 trillion ($5.6 trillion) and $US7 trillion. A 2012 report by advocacy group Tax Justice Network gave a higher estimate of between $US21 trillion and $US32 trillion. It put global tax revenue lost to tax havens at between $US190 billion and $US255 billion a year.To stop taxpayers shifting assets or income offshore, the OECD says governments need a \"comprehensive reporting regime\" that covers different types of investment income including interest, dividends and similar. This would require information on account balances to avoid \"situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide capital that itself represents income or assets on which tax has been evaded\".The OECD says this standard should not only apply to individuals, but also \"interposed legal entities or arrangements such as shell companies, trusts or similar arrangements\". \"A comprehensive reporting regime covers not only banks but also other financial institutions such as brokers, certain collective investment vehicles and certain insurance companies.\"Exchanging informationThe OECD standard builds on international treaties and agreements Australia already has in place with countries such as Switzerland to exchange information. Australia has information-sharing agreements with tax authorities in 35 countries and treaties with 44 countries. In 2012-13, these exchanges resulted in $500 million of tax, penalties and interest, according to the ATO.A related issue is whether governments publicly disclose the tax paid by large companies. The Abbott government may wind back changes, giving the tax office the power to publish details of tax paid by big companies, despite moves in countries such as the UK towards this.Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos does not see the need for such information to go public, and in an interview with The Australian Financial Review last month, Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD's centre for tax policy and administration, warned publicising it could be \"misleading\".The OECD's hope is that governments agree to one global reporting standard for exchanging information and legislate by next year. The other issue that will be dealt with at the G20 is tax paid by tech companies such as Google and Apple.", "AFR_1043": "Revelations by former spy Edward Snowden about the close links between the United States National Security Agency and US technology companies prompted one of the first investments by Australia's newest technology investment team.Alex Pollak and Paul Davis, the founding partners of Loftus Peak, reckon Snowden's destruction of community trust in US technology companies opens up enormous investment opportunities.The idea that business and individual trust in US technology stocks is broken is not new. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, which supplies internet routers, this week warned the internet was \"the wild, wild west\" and \"anything goes\" for spy agencies.Pollak and Davis differ in their response by trying to see who will benefit from the NSA-induced disruption. Their \"Snowden response\" was to invest in a Finnish data security company called F-Secure. It is trying to capitalise on the shift to cloud-based security while taking a stand for individual privacy and digital freedom.Pollak says unlike many US security companies, F-Secure won't be providing a back door entry to its servers for NSA officials demanding data. That will be a very strong selling point for a company that can sell its services globally.This example sums up the investment philosophy behind the Loftus Peak Global Change Model Portfolio is aimed at \"sophisticated\" investors, ie anyone with net assets of $2.5 million.Pollak is drawing on 20 years of experience as an analyst and executive director at Macquarie Group where he was the lead analyst for two highly disruptive stocks, SEEK and Carsales.com.Davis is a technology specialist who secured his disruptive credentials by founding online broker ETrade then selling it to ANZ Banking Group for $400 million.Along with Ashley Young, Davis managed the ASX listed Technology Investment Fund from 1999 to 2010. It delivered an excess return over its benchmark of 11 per cent per annum.There are some unique aspects to the Loftus Peak business model not the least of which is the willingness of the fund managers to share all of their ruminations and technology thought bubbles about global technology trends.Investors in the Loftus Peak investment portfolio, and anyone else for that matter, can follow the conversation through a Google drive community.The online conversation between Pollak, Davis, Young and portfolio manager Anshu Sharma combines a mix of insightful and eclectic observations about events that may provide clues to the next wave of technology disruption.The team combines the wisdom of experience with sound financial analysis although Davis has managed to convince Pollak that the traditional broking analyst's approach to financial analysis is flawed.Instead of feeding numbers into a model to arrive at a conclusion that was desired right from the start, the Loftus Peak team takes the numbers of today and feeds them into a global thematic about disruptive change.The Loftus approach recognises that the vanilla earnings forecast is fundamentally flawed. It fails to take account of the digital forces that are changing entire industries.A unique feature of the investment portfolio structure used by Loftus Peak is that each customer has an individually managed account. The shares picked and purchased by the fund manager are actually held in the name of each investor.Each managed account is administered by Mason Stevens, a boutique Australian company chaired by former Westpac chief financial officer Pat Handley. The custodian is HSBC.The initial stock portfolio is split about 80 per cent in big name global technology companies and about 20 per cent in the smaller disruptive tech stocks such as F-Secure.It will typically hold about 10 to 30 investments and may move to 50 per cent cash from time to time.Early investors in the fund include Apple, Google and Amazon.Pollak says it is amazing that Apple is trading at only six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Compare that to the forward earnings multiple for the Australian market of about 15.Pollak says Amazon is becoming the world powerhouse of retail and is challenging the supremacy of US retailer Walmart.He says Amazon's sales in 2013 were $US74 billion ($80 billion) which looks smaller than Walmart's at first glance, since Walmart is about $US450 billion.However, independent analysis shows the inclusion of third party sales in the Amazon revenue numbers virtually doubles the quarterly sales to $US47 billion, which annualised is almost $US200 billion. While that is still less than half of Walmart, it is growing much faster.Google is attractive to Loftus Peak because of its power and its reach, characteristics highlighted in a recent letter to Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt by the chief executive of Axel Springer, Mathias D\u00c3\u00b6pfner.That letter is worth reading for its warnings about the power of a company that is now one of the top 10 in the world by value but did not exist 10 years ago.Pollak says Loftus Peak wants to find the companies that will prosper from disruption in communications, health sciences, robotics and big data.tony.boyd@afr.com.auTwitter @TonyBoydAFRTony Boyd", "AFR_1056": "Schapelle Corby , bless her, just keeps on giving.The federal police's dramatic raid of Seven West Media HQ and its Pacific magazines division on Tuesday was one thing.

He is fighting the charges.The prosecution follows a lengthy Fair Work Australia investigation which concluded he had inappropriately used union funds, including spending thousands of dollars on escort services and adult movies.Public release of documents unearthed during the investigation was sought by the Coalition in opposition through a Senate inquiry in 2012 but Labor's then chair of the committee, Gavin Marshall, blocked the release, citing the potential for the misinterpretation of the evidence and privacy concerns.Now the court process has brought some of that evidence into the public realm.

The case continues.", "AFR_1015": "Surveillance Federal parliament is preparing to debate, next week, the second of three bills giving intelligence agencies extended powers. But senator John Faulkner argues scrutiny of agencies must also keep pace.Of all the responsibilities of the Australian Parliament, none is more important than ensuring the security of our nation and its people. Today we confront emerging and serious threats to our national security.The Australian Parliament's responsibility is clear. It must ensure our intelligence and security agencies have the necessary powers and resources to protect Australian citizens and Australian interests. But these powers can impinge on the values and freedoms on which our democracy is founded - qualities which Australian citizens rightly expect Parliament to protect.So Parliament must strike a balance between our security imperatives and our liberties and freedoms. Key to achieving this balance is strong and effective accountability.Throughout the 1950s and '60s, in the mood of the Cold War, unsupervised by either Parliament or public, ASIO followed and spied on thousands of Australian citizens. At the behest of the Menzies government, it used its remit to protect the country against subversion in the broadest political way.Opposition to the policies of the government was often enough to draw ASIO's attention. Many who opposed the government's position on the banning of the Communist Party of Australia, or the sending of troops to Vietnam, or those perceived to be communist sympathisers or fellow travellers in trade unions or the Australian Labor Party were the focus of ASIO surveillance.The reputations, careers and lives of many people were, as a result, blighted. The political system and ASIO's standing were damaged by the heightened suspicion and lack of trust this engendered, especially among those on the left of politics. It has been a difficult legacy to shake.Our first intelligence agency, the Australian Intelligence Corps, was established within the armed forces as early as 1907.The partisan nature of surveillance began early. Beyond enemy aliens, the concentration of intelligence agents during the First World War was on the anti-conscription campaigners, especially after the prime minister, Billy Hughes, was pelted with eggs at a rally in Warwick, Queensland, in November 1917. The prime minister believed that the Queensland police took too little action against the perpetrators and he subsequently established the Commonwealth Investigation Branch (CIB), a small force of 46, later named the Commonwealth Police, to \"overcome the unreliability of the State police forces\".Surveillance focused on peace movements, returned soldiers' organisations that spoke against conscription, but also Bolsheviks, Irish nationalists, trade unionists and Labor Party members.At that time, anti-conscription views were not just considered a matter of policy difference or party political opposition, but were seen by many in the establishment as \"evidence of treason, disloyalty and security risk\".In the interwar period, instability was fomented by the fear of revolution and the great bitterness of returned soldiers left unemployed by economic depression. There were strikes, riots and pitched street battles between police and the unemployed. Disillusioned by the economic circumstances at home, many returned soldiers split their allegiances between the extreme left and right of politics.Surveillance, however, was targeted almost entirely on the left of politics - members of the International Workers of the World or communists - but not at militarily trained right-wing groups: the Sane Democracy League, the Home Defence League, the Old Guard and its splinter group, the New Guard (both of which were closely aligned with business) and the Victorian League of National Safety.A Catholic network, largely in the trade unions and the Labor Party, reported regularly to the security services and, after 1948, to ASIO. The Hope royal commission reported that the employment of the Catholic network by military intelligence, the CIB and ASIO lasted longer than any of the others.Not only were these organisations, with the exception of the New Guard, not under surveillance, they were conduits of information to the security services about activities on the left of politics.At the end of the Second World War and with a Labor government in charge, the United States withheld security information from Australia. A meeting at the Pentagon in Washington was told that:Because of political immaturity, a leftish government influenced by communist-infiltrated labour organisations and the fact that Australian government activities have violated the basic security principle that classified information should not be divulged to unauthorised persons, Australia is a poor security risk.In 1949, in response to espionage activities in Australia and growing concerns about Australia's security, as well as pressure from the United States and particularly Britain, the prime minister, Ben Chifley, by administrative fiat, established ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.Neither the establishment of ASIO nor direct representation by the Chifley government in Australia to the administration in Washington brought any change to the embargo on Australian access. This was not lifted until after the election of the Menzies government in December 1949.The document governing the establishment of ASIO was a single-page memorandum - startling in its simplicity and significance.It gave little guidance, but did seek to emphasise the defensive and non-executive nature of the organisation - that is, it was given no police-like powers to detain - confining it to counter-espionage rather than broad community surveillance.From the outset, there was an argument about accountability. In 1956, the prime minister, Robert Menzies, when introducing the([bill which would give ASIO a legislative status) argued that too great a ministerial oversight would suggest political interference:The bill makes no attempt to specify the manner in which, or the degree to which, ministerial authority should be exercised in relation to the service. It is clearly impossible, and in any event undesirable, for a minister to exercise in this field the same degree of supervision and authority that he exercises in his own department.The leader of the opposition, Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, disagreed. He argued there must be ministerial responsibility for the organisation. This began a long argument between the left and right of politics about the nature and degree of supervision and scrutiny that should apply to intelligence agencies. Evatt said:We want ministerial responsibility in a general sense. I do not mean that we want detailed consideration of every particular activity of the organisation, but there must be a supervisory minister responsible to the Parliament and to the people.In practice, the then head of ASIO, Colonel Charles Spry, reported to the attorney-general with authority to directly approach the prime minister on matters of national importance, while both the attorney-general and prime minister were routinely briefed by Spry and his successors. In the 1980s, Dr John Burton spoke about an experience he had soon after he became secretary of the Department of External Affairs in 1947. Burton said he was approached by Colonel Spry, who was then director of military intelligence.According to Burton, Spry's suspicion of Labor ministers extended beyond merely a reluctance to inform them of intelligence findings; it was, he believed, the role of intelligence agencies to supervise the electoral mandate. Dr Burton said that Colonel Spry told him:It was the role of security services to protect democracies against themselves. Parties could come into power on a program that promised better living standards, but once in office they might act outside this mandate ... It was the duty of intelligence and security officials to ensure that this did not happen by keeping such parties out of office.Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the nature and attitudes of the director-general and his close personal relationship with the prime minister contributed to concerns about partisanship. Spry's and Menzies' successors did not share such close ties.Enormous discretion was vested in the director-general of ASIO. He could advise ministers where he was satisfied that it was necessary to do so. That choice, in part an outcome of the \"independence\" of the agencies, could also be a means by which agencies could deceive a government. Equally, if there were a close, personal and sympathetic relationship between agency or agency head and ministers, such as between Spry and Menzies, the power to advise when necessary could be used to provide political support.Over the next 20 years, concerns about the partisan nature of intelligence gathering and intelligence matters became entrenched on the left of Australian politics.Suspicion about this partisanship reached its zenith in the Australian Labor Party with the defection of Vladimir Petrov on April 3, 1954. Petrov was third secretary of the Soviet embassy in Canberra and a colonel in the KGB.Prime minister Menzies informed the House of Representatives of the defection on April 13, 1954. The timing of Menzies' announcement coincided with the opposition leader, Dr Evatt, being absent from the House. David Horner's The Spy Catchers, the official history of ASIO, notes that Evatt:... asked to see Spry about the Petrov defection, but Spry replied that Menzies had told him not to speak to him, but that he should direct any queries directly to the prime minister.Menzies' failure to inform Evatt after the defection and before his public announcement, and his instruction to Spry not to speak to Evatt, betrays Menzies' political motives. Petrov's defection and the early hearings of the Royal Commission on Espionage dominated the 1954 federal election and contributed to a narrow Labor defeat.ASIO inherited about 250,000 dossiers on Australian citizens and, over the years that followed, that swelled to hundreds of thousands more. The scale and nature of the surveillance became a matter of great controversy, especially during the Vietnam War and a new conscription debate in the 1960s and '70s.In light of the close ties between the intelligence agencies and one side of politics and the perception of partisan motives that came with this familiarity, the Whitlam government established the Hope Royal Commission in 1974. Justice Hope investigated the past practices of ASIO and the extent to which the agency was prepared to deal honestly with the Labor government.A controversial \"raid\" on ASIO was ordered by the attorney-general, Lionel Murphy, in March 1973. Murphy believed ASIO was not telling him the truth about the intelligence collected on the unrest in the Yugoslav community, which illustrated the delicate line between political responsibility, accountability, transparency and independence. While it was seen as intemperate and improper at the time, Murphy's raid also illustrated the extent to which the Labor government had lost trust in the impartiality and objectivity of ASIO.The Hope royal commission was the first real scrutiny of the organisation since its creation. Hope's criticisms were significant, at times scathing. His conclusions were often expressed as ways ASIO should not behave in future, rather than as statements about specific past wrongs. For example:Evidence was made available that ASIO has in the past provided selected people with secret intelligence material for publication. It is no part of ASIO's intelligence dissemination to publicise threats to security. It has no authority to engage in propaganda. It is a misconceived enterprise resulting in discredit to ASIO.By way of example: Robert Mayne, a Sydney journalist, claimed in 1970 to have received from then NSW Liberal Party member and editor of The Bulletin, Peter Coleman, ASIO files on five \"left wingers\" to be used in articles in the magazine, Analysis, registered by Coleman. The intention was to discredit radical individuals, members of the ALP and political organisations such as the Vietnam Moratorium. Between 1962 and 1972, ASIO distributed 67 sets of briefing papers to the Australian press.The Hope royal commission recommendations, published in its first report in 1977, have influenced the structure and oversight of the intelligence agencies ever since. A new act to give much more specific legislative basis to ASIO was passed in 1979.Hope recommended that, while ministerial direction and control remain in the broad, the director-general would be statutorily independent on whether a matter was relevant to security and the detailed conduct of intelligence operations. He also believed that the director-general of ASIO was responsible for ensuring that his advice to ministers was formulated objectively and on the basis of comprehensive information, independently verified. Finally, Hope asserted that intelligence activities should be conducted in accordance with Australian law.In 1983, prime minister Bob Hawke established a second royal commission under Justice Hope. Its intention was to review the implementation of the recommendations made six years earlier.In response to the second Hope commission, the Hawke government also proposed a parliamentary committee be established to oversee ASIO, a move opposed by the Coalition parties. They claimed the committee would be a device for the ALP probing into ASIO's secrets. According to Neil Brown, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, it would cause the demise of ASIO. He told the House of Representatives:There are people whose conduct with respect to this debate on security services and whose behaviour in saying what they have give one very grave doubt about whether they are loyal to this country. So far as the proposed parliamentary committee is concerned, it will utterly, excessively, unfairly and improperly restrict the activities of ASIO and has nothing to commend it.For some in the Coalition, the very suggestion that there be parliamentary oversight and public scrutiny of ASIO questioned the patriotism of the Hawke government. The Coalition refused to supply members to the committee until 1988, and promised to dissolve it if elected to office.Today there are six intelligence agencies in the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC): the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS); the Australian Signals Directorate, (ASD); and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO). The other two agencies are analytical agencies: the Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO); and the Office of National Assessments (ONA).In the period since the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001, the size of Australia's intelligence organisations and their budgets have more than tripled. Publicly available information on ASIO's expansion shows its staff of 565 in 1999 had grown to 1792 by 2013. ASIO's budget expanded from $65.7 million in 1999-2000 to $443.8 million in 2013-14. The ASIS budget in the same period has risen from $42.5 million to $258 million, while ONA's budget has also risen from $6.8 million in 1999-2000 to $33.6 million in 2013-14.In line with the growing size and funding of intelligence agencies, their powers have grown exponentially in the period following September 11, 2001. A significant volume of legislation passed through the Parliament has given the intelligence agencies and other security agencies, including the Australian Federal Police (AFP), unprecedented powers.These new laws included: new terrorism offences with a broader definition of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organisations; laws prohibiting the financing of terrorism or receiving funds from a terrorist organisation; laws against advocating or praising terrorism, associating with terrorist organisations or recruiting for terrorist organisations or giving support to a terrorist organisation.New legal regimes have introduced control orders and questioning and preventive detention powers for the AFP and ASIO, increased powers for the AFP to obtain documents, increased surveillance powers for intelligence agencies and police, new anti-money laundering rules, new stop and search powers, and new Criminal Code regulations, which have listed proscribed and banned terrorist organisations.Currently, a range of mechanisms is available to scrutinise the Australian Intelligence Community. At the heart of these arrangements are the three pillars of oversight: ministerial responsibility, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS).Ministers, through the National Security Committee (NSC), set the priorities of the intelligence agencies, broadly once a year. What is agreed by the NSC (prime minister, deputy prime minister, treasurer, foreign minister, defence minister, attorney-general and minister for immigration) and the heads of agencies are very broad parameters in an order of priority. Agencies then collect and analyse material as they see fit to meet these priorities. Ministers receive daily written briefing papers from the two analytical agencies on the agreed priorities. Direct briefings from the collection agencies are less common.Apart from the setting of general priorities, the first level of scrutiny of agency activities is through the warrant system. Ministers must sign warrants or authorisations for ASIO's surveillance of Australian citizens or non-citizens, or for the questioning and detention of Australian citizens. Warrants under ASIO's questioning and detention powers must be approved by the minister and issued by an appointed judge or magistrate. Warrants are not required for the listening to or capture of telecommunications by ASD, whose surveillance has predominantly operated outside Australia. However, where ASD does collect information that involves Australian citizens then they too require authorisation in writing from their minister.The PJCIS examines the administration and expenditure of all AIC agencies and reports annually to the Parliament.However, the committee is specifically prohibited from examining the operations of agencies, though it has looked into intelligence on the Iraq war and does have a role in examining counter-terrorism legislation and the listing of terrorist organisations.The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security fulfils the role of detailed scrutiny of the legality and propriety of the agencies' operations - specifically agencies' compliance with ministerial guidelines and directives, and respect for human rights. It has significant powers to investigate concerns raised by members of the public and public officials (past and present) about the activities of the AIC. The IGIS has the power to decide on inquiries and to enter the agencies and seek and inspect papers.The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was established in 2011 to examine the operations, effectiveness and necessity of the extraordinary legislation passed in the past 14 years to counter terrorism.The Abbott government announced the abolition of this important position in March 2014, but later reversed that decision.Despite all the mechanisms in place, the integrity of the actions of agencies remains dependent on the quality and integrity of their leaders, and on their willingness to adhere not only to the letter but also the spirit of the law.Today's legal framework specifies that agencies must exclude from their functions:Undertaking any activity for the purpose of furthering the interests of an Australian political party or other Australian political organisation.However, despite all the changes since the Hope royal commission, the agencies are still the subject of controversy and a degree of suspicion - especially in the press and the court of public opinion. Part of the problem today lies in the enormous changes made to the resources and powers of the intelligence agencies since the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001. There has also been a series of actions taken by democratic governments, which have been very controversial, not just in changes to the law, but in decisions to go to war, the treatment of people detained - either as a result of war or within states on terrorism charges - and the extension of state surveillance to unprecedented levels.One principle continues to be vital and needs to be reiterated: the greater the power, the greater the need for scrutiny. This is critically important in areas that affect the liberties and freedoms of individuals or decisions relating to war.The decision to go to war in Iraq raised questions in Australia about the quality of intelligence assessments and the public use the government made of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD). A parliamentary inquiry into that intelligence did not receive all the pre-war assessments, but was assured by the director of the Office of National Assessments that it was given a \"reasonable reflection of what was said\".The committee found that \"the AIC assessments are more moderate and cautious about the existence of Iraq's WMD than those of their partner agencies, particularly those of the United States ... [That] the pre-war assessments that were most accurate were those that were most sceptical. These were the assessments ... provided by DIO.\"However, the committee was most critical of the government's use of the intelligence prior to the decision to go to war. The government claimed that intelligence proved that \"Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations\". As the committee found: \"This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of the assessments provided to the committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.\" There has been no further inquiry into this issue.The case of Dr Muhamed Haneef revealed the capacity of counter-terrorism laws to infringe the rights of an individual and to deny just treatment. The Haneef case also highlights arguments, which have not been resolved, about the power to detain people.Dr Haneef was arrested on July 2, 2007, held for 12 days without charge, during which he was questioned for only 12 hours. He was charged with providing support to a terrorist organisation.On July 27, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew the charges due to insufficient evidence.There are also questions about whether ASIO should disclose its reasons for adverse assessments. These questions often arise in relation to immigration cases. In May this year, the Parliament reasserted the rights of ASIO to make assessments affecting refugees in secret and maintained the system that those assessments cannot be reviewed by an independent tribunal.In May 2013, Edward Snowden flew to Hong Kong and subsequently to Moscow having offered large amounts of information (an estimated 1.7 million documents) collected by the National Security Agency of the United States to The Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post. They revealed a massive program of collecting records of every phone call that every American makes, as well as those of millions of people around the world. This surveillance included the leaders of friendly nations.The shock of these revelations is related to the scale of the operations and the indiscriminate nature of collection.Snowden's revelations alleged similarly broad scooping up of information in Australia - possible surveillance of the phones of the President of Indonesia and his wife.Coincidentally, just as Snowden was revealing the National Security Agency programs, Australia's Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence was considering further broad-ranging changes to Australia's intelligence and surveillance laws, including, most controversially, metadata retention.The IGIS has argued that ASIO should report to Parliament annually on the use of its surveillance powers. This occurs in similar agencies overseas.Terrorism has been an enabler of a new phase of intelligence activity with the added dimension of the new technological capacities of governments. It has brought with it all the old challenges: security and community safety versus privacy and personal freedom, freedom of speech and freedom from government intrusion.Many of the curbs that were placed on intelligence agencies as a result of the excesses of the 1950s, '60s and '70s have been reversed by the legislative response to the attacks of 9/11 and, as a result, there has been a return to problems not unlike those that led to the Hope royal commission here and the Church Committee inquiry in the US.Many countries are grappling with the question of how to manage expansion of their intelligence capabilities and, in the process, balance personal freedom and national security. One of the key aims of increased oversight must be that intelligence services - in all but exceptional circumstances - continue to respect the rule of law.Britain, the United States, Canada and New Zealand are nations with political systems and security risks comparable to our own. They are also our partners in the \"Five Eyes\" security alliance - an intelligence-sharing alliance originating in the Atlantic Charter of the 1940s.In each country, oversight is managed by a combination of structures that draw on executive, parliamentary and judicial oversight. Given the commonalities of governance, security capacity and security risk, analysing the oversight structures of these nations provides an opportunity to think through how Australia might reshape its own regime of accountability.In sum, certain aspects of the oversight capacities of each of Australia's Five-Eyes partner nations provide useful examples and suggest possible improvements to our own. The comparable security risks and political systems in these nations suggest that we could comfortably adopt the best of these measures and apply them to our own security agencies. In the following, I outline a way forward, which draws on international best practice.A serious examination of the effectiveness of the oversight of the Australian Intelligence Community is now long overdue, particularly as the agencies' powers, functions and resources have changed and expanded dramatically over recent years.Achieving best practice oversight requires new thinking, additional measures, improved mechanisms and better resourcing. To address current shortcomings, this paper proposes a parliamentary committee with more flexible membership, greater powers and resources, the capacity to generate its own inquiries, better co-ordination with the IGIS, oversight responsibility for the counter-terrorism elements of the Australian Federal Police and mandatory sunset clauses and review for controversial legislation.The case is made for a comprehensive review of the oversight of Australian intelligence agencies. The timing for this review is right as further security measures are brought to the Parliament for consideration.I would argue the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security should have access to classified reports such as the 2011 Independent Review of the Intelligence Community (the Cornall Black report).The annual reviews of the intelligence community by the Office of National Assessments and by the National Security Adviser should also be made available in some form to the committee, as well as key policy documents concerning the protection of human rights.It is clear that some types of information are so sensitive that they should not be provided to the PJCIS, even if the committee were given a broader remit.The committee should also be able to generate its own inquiries and work program, in order to ensure the authority and independence of its work. This would bring the PJCIS into line with equivalent parliamentary committees in the US and Britain.The relationship between IGIS and the parliamentary committee should be formalised and broadened. The Inspector-General is clearly the most appropriate body to undertake inspections and audits of the operations and legal propriety of agencies' actions and to handle complaints. However, there is no question an understanding of issues of concern to the IGIS would be valuable to committee members.It is critically important the resources available to the IGIS keep pace with the increased size, resourcing and power of AIC agencies.The office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (not including the Inspector-General herself) comprised (just) 13 staff, according to her 2013 annual report, unchanged since a year earlier.Yet at the same time, ASIO's staff had increased from 1812 at June 30, 2012, to 1904 at June 30, 2013, according to an ASIO submission to the committee.The Abbott government recently moved to boost the resources of the IGIS, nevertheless, the government and the Parliament must ensure the resources and level of staffing provided to IGIS continue to meet the growing demands and responsibilities placed on them by the expansion of the intelligence community and its powers.The AFP now plays a central role in Australia's counter-terrorism framework and, to ensure comprehensive and consistent oversight arrangements, it is critical that the AFP's counter-terrorism elements be added to the list of existing organisations reviewable by the PJCIS.The lifespan of too many Australian sunset clauses has been too long. It is simply not possible to predict the nature and extent of terrorist threats over a 10-year period. Giving future sunset clauses a three-year lifespan would be a more appropriate period to meet immediate threats to national security and give a new Parliament, with a fresh perspective, the opportunity to reconsider their necessity.The time has also come for a thorough review of the current arrangements for oversight of Australian intelligence agencies.Not only has oversight of the intelligence agencies failed to keep pace with their burgeoning role and powers, it has been decades since the effectiveness and adequacy of their oversight framework have been critically examined.It is time to satisfy the Australian community, the Parliament, and the agencies themselves that we have got this right.Enhanced power requires enhanced accountability. The greater the potential for that power to infringe on individual liberties, the greater the need for accountability in the exercise of that power.This is not to suggest that our security and intelligence agencies are acting perniciously or misusing their powers. I do not believe that to be the case.But in the relatively recent past, those powers were used inappropriately, with a consequent erosion of public trust, and we must be conscious that enhancements we agree to now may lend themselves to future misuse in the absence of appropriate and effective accountability mechanisms.John Faulkner is a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. He is a Labor senator for NSW, and a former Labor minister for defence and a member of the National Security Committee of federal cabinet.

In contrast, the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has 13.", "AFR_1014": "The longest-serving director of the US National Security Agency says former contractor Edward Snowden has become a Russian puppet and was responsible for the most damaging intelligence breach in history.In the most comprehensive interview of his career, General Keith Alexander told The Australian Financial Review Mr Snowden's theft and leaking of over 100,000 classified documents meant lives would be lost as a result of adversaries being made aware of intelligence methods, and criticised the award of the Pulitzer Prize to newspapers who published the documents.General Alexander is at the centre of a polarising debate on surveillance practices triggered by Mr Snowden's decision to publicise how the NSA hoovers up global communications data when collecting foreign intelligence. He said the NSA had been \"vilified and misrepresented in the press\" but had been guilty of \"terrible public relations\" in explaining the issue to the public.In a wide-ranging discussion, which is published in full on The Australian Financial Review website, the former spy chief said accusations that the NSA was building personal dossiers on citizens based on phone call metadata were untrue, and warned that North Korean cyber-attacks on South Korea's banks last year could have easily triggered outright war.\"At the end of the day, I believe people's lives will be lost because of the Snowden leaks because we will not be able to protect them with capabilities that were once effective but are now being rendered ineffective because of these revelations,\" he said. \"It's the greatest damage to our combined nations' intelligence systems that we have ever suffered. The biggest ever. And it has had a huge impact on our combined ability to protect our nations and defend our people.\"General Alexander conceded that the US government had no way of knowing how much more Mr Snowden had taken, and refuted suggestions he had leaked the documents due to public interest.In comments that will raise the ire of many supporters around the world, he said only a fraction of the leaks had anything to do with Americans' civil liberties and that he believes Russian intelligence is now \"driving\" Mr Snowden.He said that Mr Snowden's choreographed questioning of President Vladimir Putin on Russian television was \"probably organised to help improve Snowden's credibility so ... it would appear as if he's an independent actor\".\"So we absolutely need to know what Russia's involvement is with Snowden. And I think that is now going to be a job for law enforcement, counterintelligence and those related areas,\" he said.He forecast more problems would emerge in eastern Ukraine as President Putin sought to \"secure his borders and his legacy\" and believes globalisation is perversely contributing to greater geopolitical instability at the same time as both cyber and terrorist attacks are on the rise.In addition to stating that the \"enormous amount of espionage taking place\" was \"far greater than most people understood,\" General Alexander said all nations were \"moving towards developing offensive cyber capabilities\" that could inflict physical damage on targets.\"These capabilities are expanding and there are real risks, which can only be managed by fixing your network security,\" he said. He explicitly referenced the \"Stuxnet\" cyber-attack, which has been unofficially attributed to the US and Israel, that infiltrated and destroyed almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges by exploiting four undiscovered holes in Microsoft's Windows operating system.The general said there were real risks of cyber warfare escalating to physical conflict.He said recent North Korean cyber attacks on South Korea's banks could have spiralled quickly out of control and said Middle Eastern attackers \"nearly disabled a major US telecommunications company\" in 2012. \"If that [North Korean] attack had been more severe, we simply don't know how South Korea might have responded, and whether we could constrain that response,\" he said.He said there was a \"significant probability for miscalculation in these cases - with catastrophic ramifications for everyone\" because the \"lack of transparency on red lines, and agreed escalation protocols, was especially acute in cyberspace\".\"What we're seeing is more folks testing these boundaries with mounting numbers of state-on-state cyber-probes and sometimes cyber-attacks...The obvious public ones are the \"wiper\" viruses we have seen used against Saudi Aramco, RASGAS [a Qatari LNG company], and South Korea.\"General Alexander said he was \"greatly disappointed\" The Washington Post and The Guardian had been \"rewarded\" with the Pulitzer Prize after putting \"so many lives at risk\" by revealing vital intelligence capabilities and \"vilifying\" and \"misrepresenting\" the NSA.A Guardian News &amp; Media spokeswoman denied it had done anything wrong.\"It's a shame that some members of the intelligence establishment are more keen to defend the right of governments to gather mass data on their citizens than to recognise the legitimate role of a free press in encouraging responsible public debate,\" she said.General Alexander said he sympathised with those who felt their privacy had been violated following the Snowden revelations, but blamed misrepresentation by the media.\"The problem is that it is being portrayed in the press that everyone's data was being exploited by the PRISM program, which is wrong.

Its interim report urged private equity and venture capital firms to increase fee disclosure - a recommendation sure to play well with superannuation funds who provide most of the local money to the sector.Not surprisingly Pacific Equity Partners, the largest buyout firm, has capitulated to this new mood. Last week PEP, which sources most of its cash from offshore backers, finally achieved a first close of $1.08 billion and expects to gather the remaining money for this $2 billion vehicle within 12 months.Two of the largest institutional investors in the world, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as well as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, committed the bulk of the cash to this latest PEP venture.Fees from the fifth fund will differ from its predecessor. Investor discontent in the United States over payments made to buyout firms from their portfolio companies has sparked calls for industry-wide reform. Mindful of the new mood, PEP's partners have forgone this payment though it's understood such fees accounted for less than 1 per cent of the firm's overall revenue.The FSI's observations are far more benign and are made in the context of a comparatively favourable view of the private equity sector. However, the revival of this debate may prove ill-timed as local firms try to persuade super funds to commit fresh money.Wolseley is still in \"raise mode\" and it is widely expected Crescent Capital will look for new funds before the end of the year.

Alex TurnbullWith the recent PR implosion surrounding Uber, it is worth taking stock of just what plan, if any, Australia has with regards to transport reform and ride-sharing. Since Uber, ingogo and goCatch have arrived, they have raised the ire of taxi companies, and in the case of Uber, flouted existing transport regulations. Yet they are all filling a void for on-demand transport. The response of regulators to these businesses thus far has been timid: spotty enforcement of licensing for hire cars and taxis allowing Uber's \"screw you\" strategy approach with regulators to go well enough while doing very little to fundamentally rethink or reframe the regulatory landscape.There are broadly two narratives regarding ride-sharing services such as Uber and both of them are wrong. The first is the one from reactionary taxi industry forces such as Cabcharge: ride-sharing is illegal, should stay illegal, and taxi drivers should strike and stamp their feet until a wormhole opens up which magically transports us back to an era before the smartphone. That, needless to say, is a hopeless task and does not engage with the core issue that technology has quite radically changed what is possible and profitable in private and shared transportation.There is a similarly absurd proposition from Uber that due to the radical new invention of the smartphone everything should be permitted and outstanding public transportation rules no longer apply. Just because something new comes along does not mean corporates can decide what parts of the law apply and do not apply to them. So how should regulators and the government think about these services and transport regulation?Regulators first need to decide why they regulate transport at all. In my discussions with regulators there is a profound reluctance to take a root and branch approach to rethinking transport legislation despite the acknowledgement that a lot has changed fundamentally around these businesses. Firstly, what can a completely unregulated market not provide reliably or with certainty? First and foremost would be baseline levels of driver competence, safety, vehicle quality and other typical occupational health and safety requirements that are standard across businesses and particularly ones with minimal red tape like coffee shops. Beyond that basic requirement of licensing and ensuring the safety of drivers and passengers, what is required? Not much. However for reasons of historical precedent there are quotas on taxis, restrictions on how drivers can get jobs and even requirements that drivers wear uniforms. How does any of this serve the public interest?exposes obscene rent seekingNow, enter Uber whose key differentiating feature is not caring much at all for regulators. The driver is better off under UberX - but nowhere near as well off as if they were not having to pay an operator such as Cabcharge and having to lease a plate. Uber's value add is in telling regulators where to go and getting away with it. Uber exposes the obscene rent seeking by entities such as Cabcharge, but instead of doing something about it, governments are playing around at the margins and not, say, offering an unlimited number of licences at lower rates which would raise state government revenues, drop taxi fares, provide more jobs and give drivers higher earnings.What happens when state governments are captured by taxi licence owner-vested interests and yet too weak to enforce regulations against Uber? Two outcomes are likely: firstly, the government is continuing to engineer a massive transfer of income from consumers and drivers to Cabcharge and owners of plates. Secondly, Uber will probably end up the dominant service in Australia because of its cost advantage borne of telling regulators to get a hike and regulators doing nothing about it. That will leave Australia with a large US corporate that cares nothing for privacy, a free press, competition or, if all other technology companies in Australia are a guide, paying Australian corporate income tax. Ever.Regulators need to harden up and understand that hiding under the desk and hoping it all sorts itself out is not an option. Taxi drivers should be regulated more like coffee shops and less like utilities. Similarly, those existing regulations should be enforced and with the number of ex-Goldman Sachs employees at Uber I can only hazard a guess that serious fines levelled at the corporate and not the drivers are likely to do the trick. If not, then as these businesses become more like communications networks and less like transport businesses Australia will be left with a large, vicious foreign player as a monopolist with a disregard for the law in its DNA.Alex Turnbull is an investment banker and investor in goCatch.

However, if authorities wanted to see exactly what part of a website was accessed, such as an article that was read, they would need a warrant issued.Information at a priceThey would also pay for the information, as is currently the case, when accessing the data.The package of laws was prompted by fears of the threat posed by Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq upon their return home.\"Anyone . . . who has seen the internet footage of Australians born and bred holding up in delight the severed heads of surrendering Iraqi police and military personnel has got to be absolutely disgusted,'' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.\"The last thing we want is militarised and radicalised people roaming our streets free to do terrible things in our community.'Mr Abbott argued that telecommunications companies already kept metadata, \"and all we are saying is continue to keep holding the information you currently collect''.Government must prove necessityOpposition legal affairs spokesman Mark Dreyfus said Labor, which has yet to be briefed on the proposals, would not be \"signing a blank cheque'' and it was up to the government to justify the need for the laws before Parliament resumed on August 26.He queried the proposal to extend some of the powers the Howard government introduced - such as preventative detention - given they had never been used.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten also highlighted the metadata proposals as requiring further justification.Mr Abbott's decision to abandon a controversial proposal to water down the Racial Discrimination Act, so as to help secure ethnic community support for his terrorism laws, was applauded by the vast majority of his MPs on Wednesday.Parliamentary secretary for Multicultural Affairs, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, had been one of the many fierce internal critics of the proposal.She said Mr Abbott had shown leadership by being prepared to heed the concerns of his backbench and the broader community.Key points Law change would allow for phone companies and ISPs to hang on to metadata for two years.

If only there was more of it. If only 70 per cent of the business hadn't disappeared.The existential crisis that has gripped Rupert Murdoch's Australian arm began with a rude discovery just after 2pm on Wednesday afternoon. The Crikey news website had stumbled across some of News Corp's most intimate lingerie, and had just put it all up on the Net.The 276-page document is called the Blue Book, a weekly and year-to-date rundown of results at June 30 2013 for every News Corp business in the country.In hindsight, perhaps it should have come with some sort of health warning for sensitive and easily shocked readers. It was like a disappearing trick. It began with what seems a relatively modest figure. The Australian newspapers and magazines recorded a 14.4 per cent drop in revenue in 2013.This is a bad figure, but it hardly seemed to signal the end of the world. The fall, almost all of which came from lower ad sales, amounted to $337 million, but News still managed to clock up a substantial $2 billion of sales. It's still a lot of sales. The damage came because almost all of that drop in ad sales translated directly into a drop in operating income of $198 million.The great newspaper engine which was Rupert Murdoch's original springboard to take over the world was already under stress. In 2013, 70 per cent of its earnings disappeared, leaving operating income precariously balanced at $87.6 million. As Crikey pointed out, trying hard not to gloat, another year even half as bad as 2013 could put News Australia into the red.Murdoch's Australian editors maintained their traditional stoic demeanour - they denounced the figures as 14 months old and completely out of date, blamed it all on former CEO Kim Williams, sent out legal threats to anyone publishing the \"illegally obtained\" numbers and demanded corrections when anyone misquoted the figures.News Corp titles in the past have published the odd article based on internal Fairfax Media documents (not more than 20 or so in the last year). And nothing could be more scrupulous than their concern for the public good when The Australian published outdated salaries of senior ABC journalists.The Blue Book showed the average cost of employees at The Australian's print operations was $178,256. That included associated costs and actual salary, but that still seemed higher than most of the ABC journalists the paper had slammed as overpaid. By comparison, the average cost of employees for the Daily Telegraph was $141,214. The toilers at the Herald Sun made do with $131,944, $125,135 for The Courier Mail, and $90,990 for smaller titles like The Geelong Advertiser.Faced with this intolerable intrusion on its commercial privacy, News Corp execs had little choice but to have its lawyers drop a tactical nuclear device on Crikey, forcing them to take the document down from their website before ritually destroying all copies they had of the Blue Book.News made similar legal threats to Fairfax Media in 2012 after The Australian Financial Review published emails of former News exec Ray Adams, once a Commander of the London Metropolitan Police. The files remain on the AFR site.How bad is the position at News? The Australian, after excoriating the restructure introduced by Williams claimed that everything changed after the appointment of interim CEO Julian Clarke and chief operating officer Peter Tonagh: \"Since they took charge, print and digital advertising revenues have improved at News, and the company has made meaningful progress with a paid digital subscription model.\"News Corp was a little less sanguine in its latest accounts, reporting that Australian newspaper revenues in 2014 were down 18 per cent in US dollars. Allowing for currency movements the fall is 8 per cent in Australian dollars. That's just over half the 2013 fall, which in theory would wipe out the remaining earnings. But it's not that simple, or that bleak. News reported EBITDA (earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation, a figure close to operating income) here dropped $US67 million ($73 million). But again currency movements may account for half of this fall. What seems most likely is that the 2013 figures captured News at a low ebb. It had undergone an enormous restructure - 2008 jobs had gone from newspapers and magazines, including 964 positions moved across to Group Services.In 2014, most of the moves to group services were reversed. It creates a confused picture, but the cost savings made in 2013 should have begun to make an impact in 2014, as they did for Fairfax. The losses atThe Australian are hard to track. Consolidated accounts for The Australian show it moved from a $26.1 million loss in 2012 to a $29.6 million loss in 2013.The 2013 figure includes a $1.9 million loss from the newly acquired Business Spectator and Eureka Report. The print operations alone show The Australian's operating loss blew out from $18.7 million in 2012 to $26.4 million in 2013. The good news was losses from its digital operations dropped by $5.3 million in 2013.Print revenue was down $27 million balanced by lower costs, which were down $19.3 million. Most of the savings were marked as \"internal production\" ($10 million) and a $4.7 million saving on newsprint. For News in general, just how the new group services are structured, and where they are expensed, will determine the profitability of the various mastheads, in particular for The Australian.

These brands are normally built over many years of hard work, tempered by the reputational effect that comes from earlier successes or failures.Many people are still to realise that personal brands will also be a major factor in their ability to be a successful online consumer; one's online social currency can determine whether - and how much - they are trusted.\"That's how fundamentally it needs to be - you can put in all the insurance but the best form of trust is going to be between two people where there is a transparent relationship and they can go in with their eyes open,\" says Tim Fung, chief executive of Airtasker.Odd jobsThe Sydney-based company allows people to post odd jobs through a mobile app, which others can then bid for and complete for an agreed amount.Though Fung says a burst water pipe has been the worst incident in its two years of operation, the company last month started offering insurance for mishaps.The sharing economy may also mean stepping outside the comfort zone of traditional consumer behaviour - much of which is still largely conducted on anonymous terms.Increasingly, platforms such as eBay, Gumtree and Airbnb rely on sophisticated systems of measuring the reliability and trustworthiness of users.High scores are generated by having more and more positive reviews from other users of the platform, essentially generating a positive reinforcement loop. But an online score, no matter how trusted, hasn't stopped the horror stories that abound on the use - and more importantly, misuse - of a home rented through services such as Airbnb.Rachel Botsman, a Sydney-based analyst, has written in her book What's Mine is Yours that the more you take part in collaborative consumption, the more \"reputational capital\" you earn, the more you can participate. She argues the higher a person's review score, the wider the choices become; whether it be places to rent, who will lend you money, or engage in bartering.But much of that depends on opening yourself up to external review - and usually to a privately-owned corporation. As a result, many consumers may find themselves reluctant to join in.\"We're still coming out of an age of anonymity,\" Botsman told AFR Weekend. \"At the moment I would say most people put a higher price on their privacy than their open identity and reputation on the web.\"There may also be a large group of people who have already blotted their virtual copybooks. Ironically, this is likely to be a bigger problem for younger consumers, as older generations were lucky enough to grow up before their foolishness was recorded in easily-shared digital formats.Everything a consumer now does on the internet; every Facebook post, every tweet or reply to a blog; contributes to their online persona. Increasingly there will be a divide among a new form of haves and have-nots - those with an established \"reputational capital\" and those without.Fung says most services will rely on a reputation determined by other users, as well as that user's social history, rather than manually curating one's trustworthiness.\"If you want to see anything at scale on something like Airbnb, eBay or Etsy, it's always been done at a peer-to-peer level - it has to be trust between two parties interacting and transacting.\"Of course, this may be of little consequence to many people until they realise that companies such as eBay are the proprietors of this data, and have little commercial interest in giving that up for nothing.That may make it difficult for a consumer who has a high score on one platform, to translate that to a broader market.\"Naively when I started talking about this I didn't realise how emotional the reaction would be to this idea,\" Botsman says.\"But then the flip-side to that, when people try to use this marketplace and they can't because they're ghosts in the system they say 'hang-on a minute, I'm a super eBay seller, why can't I export that [reputation]?'\"That's when they start to see the value of what I'm talking about.\"", "AFR_1030": "What would you do if your employer started pressing you to post promotions on Facebook, so its marketing could sit among your dog photos, private passions and soccer-parent boasting?The line of what constitutes acceptable behaviour on social media keeps shifting, and often the world of business lags behind public opinion; corporate attempts to \"be social\" can resemble a bull crashing around a china shop.Digital marketing consultant Beth Powell says a US study of 600 employees finds their biggest social media worry was not being caught out using it at work, but that their boss would ask them to post on behalf of the company.About 17 per cent say they have been asked and 26 per cent say it is encouraged. This is not unlike asking them to spruik the company at their next dinner party.Powell says it is most common in the entertainment and hospitality industries: bars and restaurants.If an employer wants access to an employee's 10,000 contacts for marketing purposes, they should be prepared to pay for it, Powell argues.After all, it is a \"database\" an employee has developed in their own time.If hiring depends on how well-connected candidates are on social media, they may also ask what part of their package is based on the size and quality of their followers and friends.Employees are now asserting that denying them access to social media is just as unreasonable as refusing them private phone calls or a coffee or cigarette break.\"Quite a few companies have had the light shone on those [bans] recently. They caused disputes with staff who said they felt like their freedoms and rights were being impinged on,\" Powell says.Although snooping is common practice, many people who should know better still have open privacy settings on their account. However, checking people out through LinkedIn and Twitter is expected.\"[Legal] issues can arise if the job seeker perceives they have been discriminated against because of profiling,\" Powell says.Some employers have claimed ownership of LinkedIn contacts and Twitter accounts when staff resign.Powell says if you build up a LinkedIn database as part of your employment, then it belongs to the company and you must share it.However, you may have to determine which contacts you brought with you into the employment relationship.\"It's murky\", admits Powell, who spoke at a recent Directioneering breakfast for HR directors.There are also questions about whether an employer can claim your Twitter followers.This depends again on whether you developed that account as part of your work on company time; in which case, it should be part of your employment agreement.", "AFR_1024": "The European Parliament is poised to call for a break-up of Google in one of the most brazen assaults on the technology giant's power.A parliamentary motion says that \"unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services\" should be considered as a potential solution to Google's dominance.It has the backing of the Parliament's two main political blocs, the European People's party and the Socialists. A vote to, in effect, single out a big US company for censure is extremely rare in the European Parliament and reflects how Germany's politicians have turned against Google this year.German centre-right and centre-left politicians are the dominant force in the legislature, and German corporate champions, from media groups to telecoms, are among the most vocal of Google's critics.Since his nomination to be the EU's digital commissioner, Germany's G\u00c3\u00bcnther Oettinger has raised the idea of forcing its search results to be neutral.Google has become a lightning rod for European concerns over Silicon Valley, with consumers, regulators and politicians assailing the company over issues ranging from its commercial dominance to its privacy policy.The European Parliament has no formal power to split up companies, but has increasing influence on the European Commission, which has been investigating concerns over Google's dominance of online search for five years. Critics argue that the company's rankings favour its own services, hitting rivals' profits.Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish MEP who is sponsoring the motion, said it was necessary to consider unbundling as a long-term solution, because the commission could not \"ask the secret of [Google's] algorithm\".Google declined to comment. Executives at the company, who only became aware of the document in the past couple of days, are angry at the political nature of the motion. The resolution's final text will be agreed early next week, ahead of a likely vote on Thursday.Europe's incoming digital chief said he would consider hitting Google with an EU levy for displaying copyright protected material.\"If Google takes intellectual property from the EU, and makes use of it, then the EU can protect this property and impose a levy on Google for it,\" Mr Oettinger told Handelsblatt. Since his nomination to oversee Europe's digital sector, Mr Oettinger, currently energy commissioner, has suggested Google could be forced to be neutral and objective in presenting search results, has called for its market power to be curbed, and raised concerns about it providing software for cars.\"It must not happen that Google makes future products such as cars or televisions and European companies remain the role of the supplier,\" he said.Asked about Google and copyright protection, a spokesperson for the outgoing digital commissioner Neelie Kroes said \"the commission's job is to solve market failures and enforce rules, not target companies\".Copyright reform within the EU is fraught with difficulty, with member states, the Parliament and even parts of the European Commission taking starkly opposing positions on what it should entail and who it should benefit.Google is showing results from heavy investments in areas beyond search, with notable inroads in the mobile, video and display markets.Mr Oettinger's aides said that he has yet to flesh out his views on the detail of copyright reform.

One driver who was arrested in a sting covered by Fairfax Media returned to work for UberX the next day. \"[The Police] never gave me a fine, they never gave me a warning, so obviously I wasn't doing anything wrong,\" he said.NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian has stated unequivocally that ride-sharing is illegal and that RMS would initiate legal action \"before the end of the year\" against UberX drivers.But the propensity of Uber to pay all fines levelled at UberX drivers puts policy makers and enforcement officials in a quandary about how to deter drivers.\"I always knew there was a fairly large grey area about driving an UberX, but if Uber is paying the fine, then all this is is a slap on the hand,\" one former driver told AFR Weekend.Sources close to RMS officials said the operator is considering cancelling car registrations and suspending licences of drivers who ignore fines and continue to drive for UberX, but the claim could not be confirmed.Uber 'supports' partners 'fully'Uber declined to confirm it would pay drivers' fines and legal costs, but stated: \"We support our drivers fully.\"When asked if the group notifies UberX drivers that they risk fines and possible criminal proceedings driving for the company, Uber responded again: \"We support our partners fully.\"The former driver said UberX staff did not tell him working for the service was illegal.\"They didn't even touch on that sort of legal stuff, except to say they had our backs in terms of insurance,\" he said. More fines are expected to be handed down in coming weeks, RMS sources said.Big business is also showing some wariness towards the group. Last week, Virgin Australia canned a promotion with Uber the day after announcing it, with a Virgin spokesperson citing consumer feedback as the reason for the change of heart.In the meantime, Uber is continuing lobbying efforts to see ride-sharing supported in new transport laws.\"We would like to see the government remove any ambiguity for riders and drivers choosing to share rides as soon as possible,\" a spokesperson said.The group recently encountered a string of setbacks and bad press relating to privacy controls and suggestions it could dig dirt on journalists who gave it unfavourable coverage.On Thursday, the group hit another hurdle when it was forced to suspend operation in the US state of Nevada following an injunction from a Washoe County judge who said it did not hold the right permits to transport passengers.", "AFR_102": "In an ever changing world, there are at least a few constants. Among them is a truth that's held firm since the first time we experimented with character recognition software in the late 1980s: computers don't make much sense of blotches, smudges and scribble.This robust aphorism was validated again this week, when we were asked to assist with a paper to text conversion that had gone horribly wrong. Instead of a neat bunch of paragraphs ready to drop into MS Word, we had alphabet spaghetti.The problem wasn't the hardware, a mighty Oce multifunction machine nearly the size of a refrigerator. And the software was as good as it gets, too. But they were brought undone by random markings on the original paper document that was to be converted to editable text. Hole punching, staple marks, some handwritten annotations, blotches of uncertain origin and page headers with underlining bewildered the OCR program.There are a few lessons in this. First, anyone who wants to hand annotate a document that may be required for optical character recognition, or OCR, should do it on a copy only. We can't count the number of times we've been asked to convert the only available copy of a document and found that it was adorned with scrawl in the margins, or worse, over the text itself. It's a recipe for a poor text conversion.Second is that just in time may be a great way to organise supermarket inventory but doesn't cut the mustard when it comes to tech skills.We're amazed at how often someone will call and ask something like \"My boss wants to send out a really good-looking invitation to a seminar. Can you show me how to use a desktop publisher?\" No, we can't. Not in 15 minutes, and not by your boss's four o'clock deadline. If we want to be able to perform tech tasks when they're needed, we need to learn and practice them in advance.Third, dirty documents need to be cleaned up for an effective text conversion. For that, our scrubbing brush of choice is PaperPort from Nuance Communications. We've been using it for most of 15 years and it's still the best way we know to remove garbage from a scanned image.PaperPort is a digital document organiser: at left there's a familiar folder tree; and right of screen is a desktop area showing thumbnails of Acrobat documents, Word files, pictures and whatever else resides in the current folder.The magic lies in what can be done with those files from there.Drag a Word file onto the PDF icon at foot of screen and it will convert to that format. Drag the PDF from the desktop onto the email icon, and it attached to an outgoing message ready to address and send. Drag a scanned document image onto the OCR icon and it will be converted to text for editing. Or drop a document onto the FTP button and it will be whisked to an online storage server. Double click on a file and it appears in full size, and if the file is an image a range of special tools is on offer.It's here that this Swiss Army knife of a program keeps its document clean-up tool, and simple but effective it is. Just select an area with mouse and tap the delete key. The detritus deletes instantly. It takes a few moments to clean up most pages but occasional microsurgery takes longer. Where handwriting obscures printed text, it can be necessary to magnify and excise unwanted marks bit by bit.Once the washing is done, text conversion can proceed unhindered.PaperPort Version 12 can talk to network scanners, take photo input direct from a digital camera, annotate PDF files, and has improved ability to automatically index a library of documents, including non text-based PDFs. All this from a program that at $US199 ($229) costs less than most dedicated OCR software, and capably fills that role too.But the lesson for today is more than the merits of a particular product. Enterprise is well advised to think out in advance what tech-based tasks it might want to complete in haste some time and rehearse them at leisure. Best to discover your skills gaps before an emergency highlights them for you.peter.moon@privacy.com.au", "AFR_1044": "Life Greg Earl reports on 25 years of turmoil and achievement for Chinese refugees in Australia.Some commemorate the events at Tiananmen Square every June, some just want to get on with the good life they craved and others are experiencing a late flowering of reflection as the culture they left behind seems to overtake their new home.The 1989 generation of what in a different era would have been called \"new Australians\" are now a microcosm of their adopted nation. But scratch the surface and the remarkable stories of heart-rending personal torment and remarkable self-confidence of the Chinese who took refuge or fled to Australia after the violent crackdown on students come flooding back.Former prime minister Bob Hawke's emotional offer of temporary refuge to students already in Australia in 1989 - formalised as residency by Paul Keating in 1993 - started the transformation of Australia's ethnic Chinese population with an estimated 30,000 young, ambitious and often highly talented new citizens settling in.But their pathways to Australia were as diverse as their lives have proved since then.Michael Zhong is as committed to political change in China as he was when he arrived in Sydney in early 1989 to study English, only to watch from afar with growing sadness the crackdown on student protesters. \"I hated the Chinese government and the Communist Party but didn't believe they would kill students until I watched it on television,\" he said in an interview this week from his home in western Sydney.Zhong is a classic member of the 1989 generation, having seized the only way out of China - foreign language study - to wind up working in a Sydney factory while he did English lessons, in the time before widespread university study by foreign students.In a dramatic life since then, he studied engineering in New York but couldn't get a job, returned to Australia to a divorce, completed a PhD in engineering at the University of Technology Sydney, lost everything running a hotel business which failed and is now driving a taxi while embarking on a PhD in economics at Cambridge.Now married again, with two children and a supportive wife, brother and mother in Sydney, he is passionate about his new home: \"Australian people don't know how important freedom is. I really love Australia.\"Zhong will be taking part in several commemorative activities this week but is dismayed at the way he believes most of the 1989 generation have lost interest in reforming China. \"I'm very sad that many people, after they get permanent residency, just forget and don't care. \"He is also alarmed by what he sees as a short-term focus in Australia of making money from the rise of China with little concern about becoming beholden to the country's political values. \"I'm really concerned the Chinese government will influence Australian people through the Chinese community in Australia.\"And as for the Chinese property investment boom, he says: \"Many rich Chinese don't know how to do normal investment - they only do speculation. So [Australians] can't afford to buy the property we live in.\"'The bad culture is being brought here'Another former teacher who left China to study mathematics in Australia after the massacre said he was alarmed at how the Chinese community in Australia had been taken over by wealthy new arrivals from the mainland who had pushed aside the original long-term residents from Hong Kong and south-east Asia in Australia.\"All the bad culture is being brought from China to here,\" said the former student, who was speaking off the record due to his sensitive job. \"[The 1989 arrivals] have become the minority and our freedom of speech is being impeded in the community.\"Zhong's story of family stress, high educational achievement and enthusiasm about the Australian way of life is a recurring theme. More surprisingly, so too has been the ability of these students to return to China not long after the tragic events of 1989 - with mixed levels of attention from the security services.Wang Xu didn't make it to Canberra, where he had relatives, until four months after Tiananmen due to a crackdown on travel. Once in Australia he won refugee status on the basis he had criticised the Chinese authorities in a television interview after the massacre which would have made him subject to prosecution. \"I wasn't a student, I was a citizen and I went to the square to support them. After the killing, I felt I had to leave. It was hopeless,\" he says.At 40, Xu was older than the typical student and had already been through the mixed experience of the Cultural Revolution where he had been exiled as a high school student to the Mongolian border region but discovered an aptitude for art.With Australian residency but no skills, he set about earning a living painting portraits of tourists in Sydney's Darling Harbour while working his way through art school to secure a masters in fine art. He's now one of Australia's leading Chinese artists with regular exhibitions and entries into the Archibald Prize portraiture competition. Last year's entry was The silenced: from 1957 to today, a group portrait of the so-called rightists who were purged in the first Communist Party crackdown on dissent in the 1950s. It marks a late-life coming out as a political activist by Xu after years of developing his artistic skills and is the result of an eye-opening journey through China in 2009-2012 talking to the now aged victims of the purge.It's a sign of the changing economic and political landscape that several 1989 generation artists have now returned to China to live because the market for Chinese art is much bigger there. But Xu is unconvinced: \"If I lived in a city like Beijing life would be good but it would still not be fair because I could not say some things.\"Quietly catharticThe Tiananmen killing had already faded from memory for some people and most 1989 generation members had residency by the time Min (name changed to protect privacy) arrived in Canberra after a long and frustrating wait to get the chance to leave China under Australia's family reunion immigration rules.But as a young medical specialist at the nearest hospital to Tiananmen - the renowned Peking Union Medical College - she was called from her dormitory bed on the morning of June 4 to help with a flood of casualties from the crackdown. It was a much more raw insight into the tightening of political control in China than Australian residents like Zhong would ever experience - which made the long wait for a way out all the harder. \"I was quite upset at the time with the government and told myself I should leave,\" she says from the Sydney medical institution where she is now an Australian qualified specialist. \"I haven't talked to many of my friends about my arrival in Australia,\" she says in the quietly cathartic way several 1989 generation members have recalled the events of that time in interviews.She was only newly back in Beijing from a one-year medical fellowship in Australia but was a regular visitor to Tiananmen for an after-work stroll with friends. But on June 3 when she passed by earlier in the day: \"It was scary. My heart was beating and telling me something was a going to happen.\"She has returned to China with no difficulty over the years and is very blunt about her choice in life: \"If I was back in China I would still be working like my other classmates with less freedom. I am very, very happy with my life in Australia.\"But Min is more sympathetic to her birth country than some former students, saying: \"There are lots of problems in China but they are going in the right direction. Some of these [China democracy activists] are stupid. Their idea is good but their way of doing it is not good.\"", "AFR_1068": "Casinos Billionaire James Packer wants to throw the dice again on buying a casino in Las Vegas. But are the stakes too high? John Kehoe reports.A dark shadow of history hangs over gaming billionaire James Packer's mooted plan to re-enter Las Vegas, the world's oldest and most iconic casino market.Packer's Crown Resorts is being touted as a leading bidder to buy a loss-making hotel and casino complex, The Cosmopolitan, on the famous Las Vegas gaming strip for as much as $US2 billion. Yet memories of Packer's disastrous foray into the United States seven years ago, where he lost millions - potentially even more than a billion - loom large in the minds of some gaming industry insiders.Crown's expansion into two business investments in Las Vegas just before the global financial crisis was a major strategic blunder as even Packer has subsequently admitted. The Crown chairman not only dusted a small fortune in shareholder and family funds in Las Vegas on the two casino deals that turned sour, he also bruised his professional reputation. Since then he has made amends, regaining his fortune with highly-profitable investments in casinos across Asia.Still, a court case is on-going in Nevada concerning one of Packer's previous failed US casino investments, with a trial due to start in January 2015. Whether this will cloud his bid for The Cosmopolitan is unclear even though gaming experts consider that the property would be a good fit for Crown.Robert Heller, chief executive of gaming and resorts corporate adviser Spectrum Gaming Capital, says The Cosmopolitan would suit Packer given Crown's large Asian customer base.A US casino would allow Packer to cycle Asian high-rollers through his casinos with attractive packages of private jets and accommodation to entice them. Packer's casino empire stretches from Melbourne to Macau and is now extending to Sri Lanka, Japan and the Philippines. The missing part to lure Asian gamblers to Crown, however, is having a Las Vegas property they can visit.Packer will have some stiff competition in the bid for The Cosmopolitan, a casino and 2960-room hotel complex, which is a five-minute walk to the award-winning Bellagio resort.Other speculated bidders for The Cosmopolitan include Galaxy Entertainment, Genting Group and US regional operator Penn National Gaming. \"For an offshore player like Crown, Galaxy or Genting, it would have strategic value to have an outpost in Las Vegas because they do have a lot of international cliental to move around,\" says Heller.The attraction of the property is also that there has been a revival on the Las Vegas strip, which lost its crown as the world's No. 1 gambling destination to Macau.\"Vegas has been bouncing back over the last few years,\" says Cameron McKnight, gaming analyst at Wells Fargo.While The Cosmopolitan is attractive it does have its drawbacks. It's built on a 3.5-hectare site, which is small by casino standards, and the complex is built upwards, with a narrow gaming floor.Timing is everythingSo should Packer roll the dice on Las Vegas again? \"It depends on the price,\" Heller says. \"If you pay too much it never makes sense. Timing is everything.\"The Cosmopolitan is said to be the most expensive casino built on the strip and it has lost more than $US300 million since it's opening in 2010. It's been put up for sale by Deutsche Bank, which apparently spent $US4 billion developing the property after foreclosing on the original developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, in 2008. It has 1325 poker machines and 121 gaming tables.Paying the right price for a US casino is a hard lesson that Packer learned a few years ago, when he over invested in the US. And it's one he's still learning.In the state court of Nevada, Packer has been fighting to clear his and Crown's name in relation to the failed $US2.8 billion Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort project. The planned 68-storey Las Vegas hotel-condominium complex was due to be finished in late 2009 after Crown invested $US250 million on its 19.6 per cent stake in the joint venture. However, the project ran into financial difficulty as the financial crisis struck.\"As soon as the GFC hit, the construction work stopped and they wrote it off,\" says a former casino executive familiar with the events. The unfinished project was offloaded in a bankruptcy sale to hedge fund celebrity Carl Icahn for $US148 million.Today, a syndicate of about 48 lenders and distressed debt investors, including funds management giant ING and a coterie of Cayman Island investment funds that lost $US700 million in financing the bankrupt project, are suing Crown, Packer himself and about a dozen of his business partners.The plaintiffs' court complaint alleges all the defendants \"materially misrepresented the cost, scope, schedule and status of the project\" and there was a \"conspiracy to commit fraud\" by them. Crown and Packer are denying the allegations and have tried to have the claims thrown out of court.Packer's other major deal in the US also ended in controversy. Crown failed to follow through on an agreement it signed in December 2007 to take over Cannery Casino Resorts for a top of the market price of $US1.75 billion. The Cannery portfolio held three casinos in Nevada and The Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino near Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The vendors selling to Packer were a group of American businessman and financiers, led by Bill Paulos, a casino veteran whom Packer and Crown chief executive Rowen Craigie knew well. Paulos helped establish the Melbourne Crown Casino in 1994 as its chief operating officer under Lloyd Williams. During his 12- month stint in Melbourne, Paulos was the boss of Craigie, who was then running gaming machines at Crown.Their historical business relationship with Paulos seems to have led Packer and Craigie years later to be comfortable in committing to buy 100 per cent of Cannery from owners Millennium Management Group (jointly led by Paulos) and Los Angeles hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management.Too much at face value\"The crew at Crown seemed to take too much at face value and there was not enough due diligence,\" a casino source familiar with the deal says.In December 2007, Craigie described the planned purchase as \"strategically and financially compelling\". Packer said Paulos and his business partners had \"created first-class local properties located in markets with attractive, long-term growth prospects\".\"Crown's skills and experience in operating successful local casinos will enable us to grow the CCR business further,\" Packer said. However, within months of those statements there was a dramatic turn of events. The crisis whipsawing financial markets slashed the value of assets including casinos.When the \"shit hit the fan\" as one source puts it, Crown began exploring legal options to withdraw from the deal, which was officially due to close in early 2009. Any major purchase in this environment would put the Crown balance sheet under enormous pressure. In February 2009, Crown reported a net loss of $409.7 million for the first half of fiscal 2009, after write-downs of $547.5 million on its stakes in casinos in Canada, the US and Britain, which had been affected by the global recession.Around this time, Crown executives and members of the Packer family, including James's sister Gretel, were being vetted by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board as part of a standard probity process to grant them a casino licence for Cannery's Meadows Racetrack and Casino. Suddenly, Gretel got cold feet about handing over her personal financial records to the authorities, citing privacy concerns over her family trust. On February 20th 2009, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board granted Gretel's request to withdraw her application in connection, official minutes show.Even though licensing was achieved in Nevada, the failure to receive approval in time in Pennsylvania meant Crown was able to walk away from a full takeover.Under the terms of agreement between Crown and Paulos, the purchase of Cannery was subject to Crown being licensed by gaming regulators in both states by an agreed date.Paulos and his fellow business partners at Millennium Management Group threatened legal action against Crown, claiming Gretel's withdrawal was an excuse for Crown to renege. Crown said the contract was terminated in accordance with agreed terms.After a war of words behind the scenes, Crown and Paulos eventually settled out of court. The official Crown disclosures to the Australian Securities Exchange state Crown paid a termination fee of $US50 million. It also paid $US320 million for convertible shares equal to a 24.5 per cent stake in the Cannery assets.Crown still holds the stake as a passive investment today. Paulos and his colleagues at Millennium (43.8 per cent) and Oaktree (31.7 per cent) remain the major shareholders.Crown's gamble to back out of the full Las Vegas purchase may have dented the company's reputation in the US, but it hasn't dented Packer's appetite for a casino there.", "AFR_1022": "A $30 million renovation at The Langham will replace the chintz with plantation shutters - but many of the original Georgian features loved by guests will stay, writes Samantha Hutchinson.When the BBC spent a year filming behind the scenes at a vaunted hotel in Mayfair, viewers were introduced to some its most enduring guests, many of whom loved the hotel so much they would live in its suites for months on end.While the practice of taking up residence for months at a time may not be a tradition at many of Sydney's coterie of five-star hotels, The Langham reckons it has forged a reputation as a luxury traveller's home away from home.Even at breakfast on a morning in early June, the home-style feeling is on show in the dining room when a guest strolls to the servery in a pair of chequered cashmere pyjama pants and leather and wool slippers.\"We've always had a reputation for being a little bit English, and we've also had a reputation for having a luxury home feeling,\" says general manager Sonia Lefevre.There are at least four guests staying at the hotel for an extended period, she says, as the man in the pyjamas takes his seat back at his table and resumes reading the morning papers.It's a reputation Lefevre reckons the iconic hotel on Kent Street - formerly known as The Observatory Hotel - will build on following a $30 million renovation scheduled to begin next month.Right on timeThe hotel, which will be closed for the renovation, will reopen in December.The Georgian-inspired foyer with a double staircase will be ripped out and the conference centre, function facilities and the hotel's ground-floor bar, restaurant and tea rooms will be extended to almost twice their current size.But the most ambitious element of the refurbishment lies in the hotel's 96 rooms. Each one will be gutted and refitted with new art deco-inspired interiors by GA Design, the same architects who designed the Corinthia Hotel London and the Four Seasons in Marrakech.As you walk into the hotel with its chintz in soft yellows, greens and blues, it seems as if the upgrade is arriving right on time. In 2012, then Langham Hospitality Group chief executive Brett Butcher told reporters the group had immediate plans to renovate the hotel it bought from Orient Express group for roughly $40 million. But Lefevre says it's taken time to get to know the guests, and to find out what works and what doesn't. In that time, the budget for the renovation has also doubled, she says.The extra spend is visible upon walking into a model of what the renovations will look like. GA Designs uses a palette based on creams with white-panelled walls, accented with shocks of soft pink, royal blue and a citrus yellow in a look that is a modern take on classic British elegance. Original Georgian fittings, including aged mahogany doors and rich, panelled, walk-in wardrobes, have been retained to keep some of the character of the original hotel. In a neat twist, they also help reflect what Lefevre calls the brand's \"English roots\", which date back to London's Langham Hotel, operating since 1865. \"There were a couple of things I had to put my foot down on, and the doors were one of the first things on that list,\" she says. \"They meant too much to visitors who have been coming here for a long time, which for some of them means 20 years.\"Other warm, modern touches come via the white plantation shutters that will stand where the chintz curtains once hung. But the chintz hasn't gone with the wind - a remnant remains in the form of the room's compendium, which is bound in a soft pink and gold-leaf floral print.Business travellers and couples who enjoy staying at the hotel for a long, romantic weekend may rarely have the opportunity to look inside the heavily bound compendium. But if you're planning on spending some time at the hotel and getting comfortable, it's worth your while to browse the Langham's extensive list of services and options, from treatments in the Chuan spa to handmade gourmet hampers designed for guests' picnics on Observatory Hill.Meals for cats and dogsSure enough there's a pillow menu - which many luxury travellers might now expect - but the pet menu begs a second look. The hotel has a number of rooms in which guests can bring their pets to stay, resting on monogrammed Langham-issue cat and dog beds, no less. The hotel also caters to the gastronomic needs of furry friends, with a menu created by Galileo head chef and alumnus of the restaurant Guy Savoy in Paris, Daniel Rudolph.\"Lassie's Favourite\" has beef steak with chunky vegetables, while the \"Meow Meow\" combines grilled salmon with green beans, quail egg, tuna, potatoes and olives. \"They look like proper adult meals,\" Lefevre laughs.According to Lefevre, it's all part of the home-away-from-home service. \"Being able to have your pet stay with you is part of how we make people feel like they're in their own home when they're away.\"There were no resident dogs to be found when Life &amp; Leisure visited the hotel, but according to Lefevre that's the whole point.\"People like us because we offer that privacy and we're a bit quieter than what you can find in other parts of the city,\" she says. \"Sometimes I walk into the bar on a Friday night, and it's staggering the people I see, but they're just in for a quiet drink because they know that's what they can get here.\"The Langham 89-113 Kent Street, Sydney Noteworthy Included in the hotel sale was the largest private collection of Sidney Nolan artwork", "AFR_101": "Google's threat to shut up shop in China seems a calculated response to the frustrations of trying to balance internet security and freedom in a repressive country. Faced with cyber-attacks and state censorship, Google wants to defend privacy and free speech from Chinese hackers targeting human rights activists and foreign corporations. Now the Australian, French and German governments have warned web users to avoid Microsoft's web-browser Internet Explorer, also infiltrated by hackers.Google has long acquiesced to China's internet restrictions but remains a minor player and has made little money in China. It might now stand to profit globally if seen to be a virtuous world citizen untainted by undemocratic compromises with China. European governments have their own concerns about US domination of the internet.But Google's experience in China, and the attacks on Microsoft, raise grave questions for liberal democratic societies. The limitless freedom of expression, information and business opportunities of the internet invite cyber-espionage by state and private interests targeting national, commercial and individual secrets. China is a repeat offender in cyber-hacking and dismissive of freedom of expression and human rights concerns.Canberra is understandably reluctant to press China - Australia's largest trading partner - on these fundamental democratic values for fear of commercial retaliation. The Rudd government's silence on the case of detained Australian businessman Stern Hu reflects this.And Australia has unclean hands because of its plans to censor sites deemed offensive. Only the US, it seems, has dared to demand answers from China (which it is unlikely to get).China should be reminded it needs other democracies as much as they need China. In a globalised world, regardless of political systems, governments need to ensure the internet is as free and open as possible and as secure and protected as necessary.China has repeatedly allowed hackers to compromise internet freedom and security.

Having been knocked back twice by the ABC and twice by SBS, Turkiewicz and her experienced producers, Rod Freedman and Bob Connolly, began passing the hat around Polish community groups that had an interest in bringing to light one of the forgotten tragedies of the 20th century.For although this documentary is essentially the story of Turkiewicz's mother, Helen (aka Helena), it also reveals the way the Poles were exploited and abandoned when the Allies joined forces with Stalin. It's a tale that hardly appears in the history books, although there must be many thousands of families in Australia who have suffered because of this conspiracy of silence. Turkiewicz's personal narrative is interspersed with fascinating newsreel footage, much of it sourced from the Sikorski Institute in London, an organisation staffed and supported by expatriate Poles.For the filmmaker, the larger story only began to take shape after she had begun investigating the facts of her mother's life. The first impetus arrived when she watched Helen sinking into dementia. In the little time that remained, she wanted to learn the truth about her mother's early years, and bring something back. This she was able to do shortly before Helen died.The project was an act of catharsis, intended to exorcise the resentment Turkiewicz had harboured all her life, after having been committed to an orphanage at the age of seven, when she and her mother arrived in Adelaide in 1953. This perceived rejection had left her feeling angry and unloved. \"How,\" she asked, \"could a loving mother do that to her child?\"Once My Mother answers that question by travelling to the tiny Polish village - now part of Ukraine - where Helen was born. Having lost both parents while she was small, Helen was taken in by an uncle who sent his own children to school while putting his niece to work. By the age of 10, penniless and illiterate, she was cast out into the world.The film tracks her journey from one place to another, until she is arrested and sent to a Russian prison camp in \"Siberia\" - although it seems to have been a region near the Finnish border. Almost too harsh to believeHelen had committed no crime, she was one of many thousands of Poles who were sent east to provide slave labour for Stalin's war machine. Everything about this period seems almost too harsh to believe: the long train journeys in crowded, sealed carriages; the forced marches over thousands of kilometres as the Poles trooped south to Uzbekistan, then on to Persia. Mere survival was a miraculous feat.With the end of the war, Helen travelled as a refugee to Lusaka, part of Northern Rhodesia. At the camp she fell in love with an Italian prisoner of war and became pregnant. The father was sent back to Italy and Helen and Sophia came to Australia. When she received a letter from her former lover's new wife in Italy, Helen knew she was condemned to being an unmarried mother - an unenviable distinction in 1950s Adelaide.It was not until she had met and married another Polish refugee that Helen was able to reclaim her daughter from the orphanage. From that point on, she became a model New Australian, complete with a happy family in a suburban home. \"God save Australia,\" she says. \"Protect us from snails.\"The only sore point was Sophia, whose rebellious nature was fuelled by memories of her abandonment. And yet, when it came time to choose a topic for her graduation work at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, Turkiewicz would draw on her mother's stories, making a short film called Letters From Poland (1979). Years later she would return to the theme with her feature, Silver City (1984), in which commercial logic demanded the immigrants spoke English with a Polish accent. Once My Mother completes an informal trilogy that will eventually make an excellent DVD package.Funding for this film finally arrived when new faces at the ABC agreed to support the production, and Screen Australia came on board at the third approach. Since making its debut on the festival circuit, Once My Mother has won a succession of awards, which should be an embarrassment to those authorities at the ABC and SBS who felt they didn't need \"another film about the Second World War\".It could be argued that this documentary is exactly the kind of film we need most urgently right now - a study of an illiterate unmarried mother who came through the horrors of war and found a safe haven in Australia. We forget how that wave of post-war migrants was actively sponsored by the federal government, and how those DPs - Displaced Persons - would undo the tight little knots of Anglo-Celtic convention that held sway in this country. Perhaps, 50 years from now, an Australian filmmaker of Iranian or Sri Lankan origins will be making a documentary about the reception their mother received when she arrived in Australia (or Christmas Island) as a refugee. It might not be such a happy ending.Reaching for the Moon'The art of losing isn't hard to master,\" wrote Elizabeth Bishop, in One Art, the poem that gets most traction in Bruno Barreto's biopic, Reaching for the Moon. \"So many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster.\" It's an obvious choice for a feature poem, as it reveals much about Bishop's spiky, self-absorbed personality. The last stanza says it all:Even losing you (the joking voice, a gestureI love) I shan't have lied. It's evidentThe art of losing's not too hard to masterThough it may look like (Write it!) likedisaster.We're encouraged to identify the \"you\" in the poem with the Brazilian architect, Lota de Macedo Soares, with whom Bishop spent 15 years. This film concentrates on that period, building up a double portrait of two brilliant women with antithetical personalities. The film shows how Bishop travels to Brazil in 1951 to visit her old college friend, Mary (Tracy Middendorf), who is living in Petropolis with the wealthy architect, Lota.At first Elizabeth is an irritating house guest, but she and Lota will discover a powerful mutual attraction. Mary is sidelined, pacified with the promise of an adopted child to raise, while poet and architect become a couple.It seems that all relationships between two strong characters, be they heterosexual or homosexual, take the same course. There is the wariness of first meeting, as mighty egos size each other up. Next comes the electrifying discovery of the intellectual and imaginative worlds held in common.Weeks, months or years down the track, it all ends in tears. It may not be very different from the most ordinary relationships; few of us can take pride in always making the right choices.The narrative in this film is largely a vehicle for an examination of these remarkable women.Miranda Otto has spoken about immersing herself in Elizabeth Bishop's poetry and letters, and everything she could find out about her, in preparation for this role. Her portrayal is presumably true to life but she makes Bishop seem a lot softer and more vulnerable than I would have imagined.Writer of rigour and precisionNo one who knows poets entertains any illusions about their heightened sensitivity as human beings, and Bishop was a writer of unusual rigour and precision. She also had that trait shared by almost every major American writer: she was an alcoholic who would go on benders when the words weren't flowing.Even when Bishop is writing in a personal vein, as in One Art, there is an air of formality. Critics will tell you the poem is a villanelle - a highly structured form of 19 lines, with two repeating rhymes and two refrains.The conventional interpretation is that the rigid structure of the poem is a way of keeping emotion in check. The more she insists that the art of losing is easy, the more we must understand it as a source of unbearable pain.Poetry, by its very nature, is a confessional art, but Bishop was always anxious to preserve her privacy and avoid categorisation. She had no wish to be known as a lesbian poet or even a female poet. The technical nature of her verse is a way of insisting on her sheer competence with no extenuating circumstances. It's a useful corrective to those gay or feminist \"artists\" who believe that gender or sexual preferences provide a licence for self-indulgence. I remember Patrick White grumbling somewhere about how he hated \"gays\".Lota, given a forceful incarnation by Brazilian actress Gl\u00c3\u00b3ria Pires, was another example of an exceptional woman who insisted on being known primarily for her work and ideas.The conjunction of these two self-made, self-reliant artists is a promising subject for a film, but Barreto tends to rush where he should have lingered, and to lay on the syrup when a scene needed to be handled with delicacy.The complex emotional entanglements of Elizabeth, Lota and Mary are poorly developed in the script, with egregious background music being used to compensate for the deficiencies. The score by Marcelo Zarvos is so heavy-handed it serves as a constant distraction - fine for a soap opera but murderous for any film with serious pretensions. It's a very simple lesson: when it comes to conveying intensity in the cinema, music is rarely so effective as silence.John McDonald also writes on visual art for The Sydney Morning Herald.Once My Mother Written and directed by Sophia Turkiewicz Australia/Poland/Ukraine, rated PG, 75 mins Reaching for the Moon Directed by Bruno Barreto Written by Matthew Chapman and Julie Sayres, from a novel by Carmen Oliveira and screenplay by Carolina Kotscho Starring Miranda Otto, Gl\u00c3\u00b3ria Pires, Tracy Middendorf, Marcello Airoldi, Treat Williams Brazil, rated PG, 118 mins", "AFR_1078": "When Bulgari turned 130 it was a big deal, writes Nora Baldenweg.It's a wonderfully sunny spring day in Rome and Bulgari has flown in about 300 guests from around the world to attend its grand festivities to celebrate the luxury jewellery company's 130th anniversary.Illustrious guests include Bulgari ambassador Carla Bruni-Sarkozy - clad in a diamond serpent necklace worth EUR8 million ($11.9 million) - and Academy Award-winning actor Adrien Brody.Socialites such as Caroline Sieber and Poppy Delevingne were also in town to discover Bulgari's new jewellery collection and the grand re-opening of the historic flagship store on Rome's famed Via dei Condotti.The most chic hotels in town are buzzing and completely booked out.A third of the guests are VIC's - very important customers - hand-picked by the Italian luxury jeweller to mingle with the Bulgari family, princesses, celebrities and aristo-socialites. No expense is spared as the well-heeled are pampered with private experiences aimed at securing their loyalty.The international press is taken on a tour through the flagship store, refurbished by renowned architect Peter Marino. At a press conference, Bulgari, which was bought in 2011 by French luxury giant LVMH, announces it will make a donation of EUR1.5 million to the city of Rome to fund the renovation of the capital's famous Spanish Steps.This is in the vein of other luxury labels giving back to their city (shoe brand Tod's is financing works at the Colosseum, while fashion house Fendi is set to refurbish the Trevi Fountain).\"Obviously events like this cost us several millions,\" says Bulgari's CEO, Jean-Christophe Babin, reflecting on the aim of such expenses. \"But they are part of our overall marketing strategy and they will have an impact on our business long-term.\" But the impact on sales is never immediate. There are a lot of steps that lead to someone perceiving a product or a brand with a higher emotional value.\"So you have to spend before you harvest,\" he says, sipping at his espresso when we meet up the next day at his office in the company's headquarters overlooking the Tiber river.Bulgari held a second gala event in Sydney this week, as a nod to Australia being one of the house's most important markets. The festivities in Rome and Sydney are definitely the biggest events for Bulgari this year, but the company makes sure to cater to its VIC's, all year round.\"All in all, this year we are hosting 325 events, which means that basically every night there is a Bulgari event somewhere in the world. We are constantly in contact with our customers, updating them on what's new, inviting them to events we believe they may enjoy,\" he explains.Earning loyaltyObviously the key to maintaining an element of exclusivity - which is what makes a brand a luxury brand in the first place - is inviting only a select few to these sorts of events.\"You can't invite more than 50 couples to an event, otherwise you lose the sense of intimacy and privacy. And that is very important in the upper luxury. But, while some customers may prefer a very intimate dinner with three or four people, others may prefer a glamorous party in a very selective place. So it is our profession to know our customers and offer them a tailor-made experience.\"Accompanied closely by their country or store managers, with whom they develop a friendly relationship over time, these customers are flown in and taken care of from A to Z. Given their loyalty to the brand, they deserve a preview before potential new clients and the first chance to pick up novelties.\"But surrounding that, we also put together a cultural programme to make sure they spend an unforgettable time with us.\" And, as Bulgari only knows too well, pleasing very wealthy customers is a craft of its own, so being creative is key. \"Meeting up with Carla Bruni for instance, money will never buy that. You can't just access her, so that is a priceless experience.\"Of course, these strong relationships are built over years, and, even if it means inviting a customer several times before they buy something, the efforts are well worth it if they eventually purchase a one-off piece.However, creating dreams and a desirable tension is still the luxury brand's biggest challenge. As Babin points out, Bulgari is not only competing against other jewellery houses, but every other imaginable way of spending money. \"If you have discretionary money, there are so many ways to spend it, so our mission is really to constantly increase the reputation of the brand, because that will eventually lead to more sales and more profit, and that is the main focus of the company.\"So what has led Bulgari to host its other big celebratory event of the year in Sydney?\"Australia has become huge for us. If I look at the spending per capita, it's the number one spending country in the world,\" says Babin. \"Of course, other nationalities - the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans, the Americans and the Middle East - they may buy larger quantities, but Australia is one of the strongest growing markets for us - despite the strength of the Australian dollar.\"And since tourists have no interest in spending their money on luxury goods in the country right now, it's mostly domestic purchases. So the brand seems to be fitting well with Australia and that is quite amazing.\"", "AFR_103": "Ute Junker checks out the villas setting new standards in luxury escapism.In travel as in comedy, timing is everything. So you'd assume that August 2008, just a few months before the global financial crisis sent the travel sector reeling, was hardly the ideal time to open a luxury property in Bali.But according to Mathias Echene, who helped create Pantai Lima, a set of five exclusive luxury villas on Bali's south-eastern coast, the crisis was in some ways the best thing that could have happened. At a time when executive spending was suddenly under scrutiny, and when any form of extravagance looked excessive, Pantai Lima could offer something that high-end resort competitors such as Aman couldn't: discretion.The sprawling walled villas allow visitors to maintain a low profile, something that became important when all consumption was suddenly conspicuous. \"When you're staying here, no one can see you, no one can report back on where you are and what you're doing,\" says Echene.Privacy is part of Pantai Lima's raison d'etre. Echene and his co-owners had a simple goal: to create villas more luxurious than anything already on offer in Bali, that would draw the creme de la creme of Asia's large army of expat executives. They designed five sprawling villas, each set in grounds of about 2500 square metres, and each featuring at least five bedrooms (one has six).Each villa has walk-in dressing rooms; indulgent bathrooms; a professional kitchen; airy living spaces; and spacious outdoor areas with two pools - one for swimming, one for splashing around in with kids. There are also 70 obliging staff working across the five villas. For those wishing to step outside their villas, there's a tennis court and a gym, and a chauffeur-driven car.So far, so indulgent. However, it's Pantai Lima's added extras that set it apart. For a start, there's nothing cookie-cutter about the villas: each has its own character. The project is a joint venture between five friends, each of whom chose the style for their own villa, with the actual designs supervised by Echene's wife, Gaelle. Although they're equally luxurious, each of the five villas offers a very different experience.Villa Waringin, for instance, has an informal, colonial-inspired feel that's a great fit for families. The biggest villa, Villa Mary, which is set among 3000 square metres of gardens, has not one but two living areas - one with views over the rice fields, the other perfectly situated to catch the sunsets - and a 20-seat cinema.Those with a flair for the dramatic will love Villa Melissa, where the long entrance corridor is defined by a stream that flows all the way through to the other end of the building, a spectacular two-storey pillared space that overlooks the pools and an intimate dining pavilion perched just above the beach.Working almost exclusively with local products - wherever possible, she dealt directly with local artisans and craftspeople - Gaelle Echene has sourced some beautiful pieces. Villa Mary, for instance, houses not just a spectacular table made from half a tree trunk - over a metre wide, it seats 15 people - but also an inventive bed that has a woven rattan base that flows up at the top to become a feature headboard, and flows down at the far end to become a padded seat.The Echenes were on a family holiday when they fell in love with Bali. \"Mathias turned to me one day and said, 'I want to talk to the agent who rented us this property',\" Gaelle recounts. \"He spent several hours on the phone with him, discussing the details of the market.\"Neither of the Echenes had a hospitality background, but they did have a unique set of credentials. He worked in finance, she had the marketing background and a passion for design; their joint hobby was property development; and they'd spent enough time relaxing in five-star properties to know what was required. In addition, their BlackBerrys were full of friends who had the ready money to invest in a major project. All they needed was to find the land.This was easier said than done on an island where property values are booming, exacerbated by a religious ruling that says no land can be developed within a literal stone's throw of a temple.That condition might not sound onerous if you've never been to Bali and seen the thousands of tiny shrines scattered throughout the island: on the sides of roads, in paddy fields, and everywhere else. Eventually, however, the Echenes found the perfect location - a secluded spot near the fishing village of Perenan, not far from Seminyak and just 10 minutes from Nirwana golf course., considered by some to be the finest in Asia.One of the Echenes' key drivers was to create a property that was not just luxurious, but also offered value for money. \"We wanted a proposition that was good value - none of this paying $25 for a club sandwich,\" said Echene. So rather than having an inhouse spa, the Echenes maintain a roster of local masseurs who will give you an in-villa massage at the going rate: which means you pay $20 rather than the $150 you might pay in a five-star resort.Similarly, the meals offer the best value fine dining on the island. On arrival, guests discuss the menu concepts for their stay - estimated budget, food preferences and so on. The executive chef and his team use the budget to buy food - and that's all it costs you. There's no surcharge for meal preparation, which is overseen by executive chef Sebastian Robuchon.Dishes include local butter fish with potato scales and Provencale ratatouille, and mango tarte tartin, served with balsamic vinegar, coconut ice cream and dried lime zest.This quiet corner of Bali might strike some as an odd location to find a top-notch chef, but Robuchon feels otherwise.He gestures at the idyllic tropical setting and says, \"The reality of this job is, it's exhausting. Here, you have other things to balance it out.\"We wanted good value - none of this paying $25 for a club sandwich.", "AFR_1070": "Opposition Deputy Leader Tanya Plibersek says she is open to Australia's spy agencies getting more access to personal phone and internet use data from telecommunications companies to fight crime and terrorism.Ms Plibersek told Sky News on Sunday that metadata collection had been an important tool in \"disrupting some very serious terrorists plots in Australia''. She said she wanted to give intelligence agencies the \"maximum ability to do their job well''.Metadata is generated when a computer or mobile phone is used and gives the date and time of a phone call and the location from which an email is sent, though it does not include the content of the call.The former Labor government shelved a proposal to force telecommunications companies to store metadata for up to two years because of a privacy backlash.The United States Congress is reining in bulk metadata collection by the National Security Agency, following revelations by fugitive leaker and former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden.However, the Australian Federal Police has called for more power to access metadata to combat crime.A Senate committee is evaluating mass surveillance laws and Attorney-General George Brandis says he is awaiting its recommendations, due in June, before considering any changes.", "AFR_1039": "Evolution We no longer need to grasp the how of technology, only what we want it to do for us, writes IT editor Paul Smith.On Tuesday, at The Australian Financial Review and Macquarie Future Forum, local tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes fielded a question about the importance of open source technology to growing businesses. Taking the pointy-headed nature of the question in his stride, the co-founder of software company Atlassian tried a light-hearted rhetorical question in response.\"How many people's servers run Windows nowadays?\" he quipped.Tumbleweeds ... tough crowd ... hardly anyone in the sizeable room of tech investors, entrepreneurs and senior executives had the foggiest what he was going on about.The correct answer, by the way, would be \"nobody's\" ... it would be way more expensive than Linux-based servers. But that was a geek step too far for an audience with little interest in the \"how\" of technology.Aside from being a lull in an otherwise entertaining discussion, the whoosh of the topic of tech infrastructure going over the heads of a room full of smart people was a great indicator of the huge impact so-called cloud computing has had on the lives of those present.This was no room of Luddites; they were a group of forward-looking, influential people whose very presence at an event focused on business disruption indicated they had a predisposition for the topic of technology change.However, the evolution in recent years of cloud-based technology is allowing a generation of business and consumer users to disdain the \"how\" and focus on the \"what\" and the \"why\" of tech use.A few years into popular usage, the idea of hosting our personal and commercial data on servers outside our own premises is becoming increasingly less troubling.The more we access all our music from different devices via an unseen online catalogue, or edit work documents on the train that were saved without thought in an online drive when we left the office, the more we come to accept the advent of a world where we happily let someone else worry about the boring techie details that underpin it.The vast computing power for sale from giant global companies has commoditised technology capacity to an extent where, paradoxically, technology is both more important than ever to business and personal life - but less important than ever for us to really understand.Harvard Business Review writer Nicholas Carr caused a storm in technology circles back in 2003 when he wrote an influential piece entitled \"IT doesn't matter\". While it wasn't specifically referring to the emergence of cloud computing, it was a prescient summation of what was to come.Carr asserted that modern technology was following a similar path to earlier developments such as railroads and electrical power. Initially those that had access reaped big commercial advantage, which was soon eroded as availability became ubiquitous.Cloud computing has shaken up the enterprise technology providers such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard because, before it came along, buying their expensive tech infrastructure was essential for big companies to function and stay ahead.The cloud changed all that and removed the barrier to adoption for smaller operations. Buying access to technology capacity \"as a service\" as and when you need it is a very different proposition to having to afford all the IT infrastructure yourself.These days, businesses and individuals can spend their efforts thinking about what they want to do with technology, rather than what equipment they need humming away in a server room before they can even start planning.As some have been trying to convince the world for years, it's not what you've got, it's what you do with it.Cloud systems are not without their drawbacks. In personal use, the need for an internet connection to access files is a concern, albeit a decreasing one. As is the horrible prospect that one day you could log on and be greeted with an empty screen, with nowhere to search for missing treasures.It would also be remiss to ignore the privacy implications of the Edward Snowden revelations. Despite some resistance to government snooping and attempts at transparency from global tech companies, storing in the cloud is never going to be as private as a cardboard box under the bed.But as anyone who has rescued an old wedding VHS from a dark corner, only to watch as the happy couple stutter and spasm their way down the aisle, can tell you ... a specialist can store your things better than you can. You make your choice.READ NEXT: Cloud control Best apps for your gadget", "AFR_1067": "Technology The web increases productivity but adds volatility to the way we live, writes David Rothkopf.The fabric of civilisation is being rewoven around us. The very nature of life, work, and society is changing so profoundly we are approaching a moment at which our old ways of thinking about the structures that sustain us may be seen as obsolete.This happens periodically throughout history - think of the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. Such eras often produce turmoil or upheaval, until leaders emerge to help shape a new order for a new age.The question today is whether our leaders are up to the challenge. Given their lack of grounding in the world's most pressing scientific and technological issues, I fear many, if not most, are not.Formerly disenfranchised populations are increasingly connecting to telecom, internet and other services. For instance, mobile-phone penetration was estimated to have surpassed 80 percent in Africa in the first quarter of 2013, according to figures published in 2012 by ABI Research. What's more, it is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else in the world. And though smartphone penetration in Africa is just 20 percent - close to global levels - it is expected to explode in the next few years.Such trends mean huge populations are connecting to one another and to worldwide communities. We are already seeing the implications in countless ways - from January's flash-mob political protests in Brazilian malls, to the crowds that have amassed in Egypt's Tahrir Square, to the success extremist groups have had in attracting recruits in Syria.ConnectivityConnectivity, of course, does more than turbo-charge and add volatility to political processes. Next year, Facebook will surpass China as the world's largest organised community, and while China has an army, history, and culture all its own, Facebook users are not constrained by borders or societal fragmentation. Sure, Facebook is not a country, but what of it? Geographically constrained communities are so 500 years ago. There are arguably stronger ties (or the potential for them) among people who share political, artistic, religious or other similarities across national boundaries, than there are among people who happen to be born down the street from one other.New technologies and widening access to them are linking and empowering people in other ways as well. Education, for instance, is becoming more ubiquitous and harder to limit to the few who can afford it. Of course, we also saw more clearly than ever in 2013 that technological change is transforming the way powerful actors - from governments to businesses to rogue groups - can capture and use information to their advantage. In the years ahead, we certainly will see that the most technologically enabled will possess ever-greater means of building wealth, keeping down their opponents, and exacerbating inequality.The economy is another front where the rapid pace of technological change is influencing virtually everything. It is making employment available outside traditional workplaces and providing new opportunities for the disabled and elderly. But it is also changing the way jobs are created, helping to produce the \"jobless recovery\" with which the United States and other economies are struggling. As Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have discussed in their important books, Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age, we are likely to soon enter a period in which considerably less traditional work will be done by human beings. Just as previous technological revolutions nearly eliminated entire classes of field workers, labourers and craftsmen, the next change will target white-collar jobs.Economies changingEconomies are changing in other ways too. Data flows are becoming as important to competitive success as capital flows. Supply chains are changing dramatically not only because of shifting sources of resources and demand, but also because of manufacturing tools that, among other things, are creating new capacities for localised production. Technologies like 3D printing, for example, may soon move some work from factories to local shops, even to homes.Giant global companies adapt better to these changes than are political entities, tied down to the land beneath their feet like Gulliver in Lilliput. My friend, author Tom Friedman, talks about these companies \"floating above\" the countries that were once their domiciles. New technologies are starting to make it possible for entire communities of people to do the same.This all suggests that traditional systems of social organisation are increasingly ill-suited for our brave new world. Take the law: even flexible constitutions like that of the United States were not built to deal with the issues that would almost certainly be occupying the framers' minds, were they alive today - like who owns the data we produce, what privacy rights we should have, and whether we are born with an inalienable right to access the internet. Existing economic models, global alliances, and international institutions are just as poorly equipped for handling the tasks at hand.Who works inside these systems is also problematic. Take the US Congress as an example, given it is the top legislative body in the world's most powerful country. Background in scienceOnly 12 percent of the US Congress's members have a background in science or technology, says a 2011 study by the Employment Policies Institute. Based on my conversations with tech executives who regularly interact with Congress, just a handful of people on Capitol Hill truly understand the implications of the big data, cyber and other technological revolutions. Turn the subject to how next-generation neuroscience and biotech developments will raise critical questions about how we deal with mental health, crime, extended life expectancy, bioethics and health-care costs, and the number falls even further. \"In many cases to zero,\" a professor at one of America's leading schools of public health recently told me.Thus the challenge is two-pronged: the structures organising the world are rapidly approaching their sell-by dates - the time at which they need to be refreshed, reconsidered, and reinvented - and the people who should be leading that process are among the least qualified to do so.This can be addressed only by bridging the worrying divide between policy making and technological development. It is encouraging to see familiar faces from Silicon Valley and other parts of the tech world more frequently in Washington and world capitals these days, but unless more show up, trouble looms.We need a wider, deeper conversation between the two sides and a major effort to find a new generation of leaders who truly understand innovation - both its potential and its pitfalls. If we find these leaders, we can harness the promise of today's multiple tech revolutions. Their benefits can extend - more than they already have - from top to bottom in a more closely integrated and ever-changing global community.Foreign PolicyDavid Rothkopf is chief executive and editor of the FP Group.

This trial will be reviewed before any decision on a full store roll-out is taken.The plan upset the Australian Medical Association and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The guild has long opposed any moves by supermarket retailers to encroach on its patch.In markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom, supermarkets are able to open pharmacies and sell prescription drugs, but in Australia that activity is restricted to registered pharmacists.The two groups are used to fighting each other but both oppose the plan.AMA president Brian Owler, who represents GPs, said the healthcare system was \"built on general practice and highly qualified GPs leading primary care teams\".\"There would be no access to patient history and ... no privacy,\" he said.Guild president George Tambassis told the ABC it was \"hypocritical\" for a supermarket which profits from selling tobacco and alcohol products to claim to be interested in healthcare.Consumer Health Forum spokesman Mark Metherell said the organisations' opposition was predictable.\"At a time when many consumers are not only time poor but also face the prospect of rising out of pocket health costs, the provision of supermarket checks is certainly worth considering,\" he said.The Grattan Institute's Dr Stephen Duckett said he saw the plan as a commercial response to the Coalition's proposed $7 co-payment for GP visits.\"People might be thinking of using Woolworths as an alternate source of advice to a GP,\" he said.", "AFR_1066": "A little fun-filled flair is the ingredient that will turn the beautiful Grampians into an unmissable fine dining destination, writes Jessica Gardner.Eight flawless courses with matching wines from the 2700 label-strong cellar were served in a restaurant just a short walk from our luxurious king-size suite looking out towards Mount Sturgeon ... yet something was missing.You're not supposed to have any complaints about Dunkeld's Royal Mail Hotel. The destination diner three hours from Melbourne has a trio of chefs' hats from The Age, three stars from Australian Gourmet Traveller and is an institution on any self-respecting weekend getaway list.Owned by the rich list lawyer and philanthropist Allan Myers, estimated to be worth $705 million, the hotel has a reputation for excellent dining and luxurious rooms at the southern end of the Grampians mountain range.It's only a small thing when the food was superb, the service never lacking, the sommelier expert and the wine eminently quaffable. But unfortunately, the Royal Mail lacked vibe.On a crisp March Saturday evening, the side of the restaurant for those dining on the $150-a-head degustation ($120 more for matching wines) was almost full but felt empty. Eight tables of two conversed in hushed murmurs. An older couple ate their food with furrowed brows. On either side of our table were couples on babymoon: the women with bulging bellies looking on with tired expressions and glasses of soda water as their husbands enjoyed the wines sourced locally and in Europe.We sat at large round tables, perched perfectly to look out to the rest of the room, where groups of rowdy, happy diners, free of white starched tablecloths, were ploughing into the bistro menu of steaks and racks of lamb.The different experiences seemed exacerbated by the interior design. The room was split in two: serious diners on a carpeted area with their backs to drab curtains; the fun guys on polished wooden floorboards looking out to the garden.Thankfully, I slept on my thoughts before writing this story, not because the feeling faded but because in the morning new Royal Mail executive chef Robin Wickens explained his vision for the restaurant. It gave me reason to want to give it a second chance and urge others to take the trip to Dunkeld as well.Fresh vision for the Royal MailWickens came into work on Sunday morning - his day off - to take us on a tour of the kitchen garden. He picked us up in his luxury 4WD, dressed in jeans and high-top sneakers, clutching a takeaway coffee.The Brit joined the Royal Mail in September 2013 after chef Dan Hunter stepped down. The Dunkeld diner lured the keen surfer from the seaside town of Apollo Bay where he had set up Wickens Provedore and Deli with his wife Kate in 2010. In the decade prior, Wickens had made a name for himself in Melbourne with his Fitzroy restaurant Interlude.While strolling through the productive 0.8 hectare garden that dictates each night's new menu, Wickens answered our questions about the fascinating Myer family, legendary in Dunkeld, where residents have apparently woken to find their nature strips anonymously mown (at the Myers' cost) to keep the town looking sharp. Wickens says Allan Myer likes to pop in to the restaurant when he's in town but he doesn't much love the degustation menu, preferring a steak from the bistro.It seemed the perfect moment for me to note that it looked like the people in the bistro were having more fun. The chef sensed my not-so-subtle feedback and nodded.It's something he wants to change. He has plans to break down the divide between the two spaces, physically and mentally, by changing the design and his molecular gastronomy-inspired menu. From mid-year, a five or eight-course tasting menu as well as the \u00c3\u00a0 la carte menu will be available in the whole dining space.It's a symbolic fix but it's more than enough to make me change my tune on the Royal Mail. I can't wait to go back.In fact, I think a bit more feedback on minor details will benefit other attractions in the Grampians before my next visit too.

It has long been popular with walkers and climbers who explore the range. We took the popular three-hour Pinnacle Walk on a Sunday afternoon, which is tough on the legs but ends in a spectacular vista down (a long way down) to Halls Gap and across the valley.The Grampians is also styling itself as a luxurious destination for food and wine lovers. Its annual Grape Escape festival, to be held on May 3 and 4, is popular but I got the impression the foodie trail may not be a completely well oiled machine.That's not to say it doesn't have potential. The region has a good reputation for cool climate wines and is especially known for its sparkling shiraz. We squished in a quick visit to two wineries in the town of Great Western - the Treasury Wines Estates-owned Seppelt and Bests - into a Saturday morning. But it felt like we could have spent longer to learn about their long history. The two wineries were established in the mid 1800s by brothers Joseph and Henry Best.Seppelt is better set up for visitors, with a twice-daily tour of underground hand-dug drives, or tunnels, but felt a tad overplayed compared with Bests' stripped-back historic offering.We popped into two producer businesses, neither of which were particularly well set up for drop-in visitors. Caron and Peter Fraser's Grampians Grove has 400 trees, mostly hazelnuts with some almonds too. The couple are very friendly and love a chat. The best place to catch them is at farmers' markets because their small shop and caf\u00c3\u00a9, which doubles as Moyston's Post Office, is a weekday and long weekend-only affair.A 25-minute drive away, just outside Halls Gap, Red Rock Olives is a new family-owned company hoping to turn 5000 trees into oils and jars of olives. A short range of oils and olive salt is already being sold but again, look out for the goods at farmers markets because the caf\u00c3\u00a9 is a bare bones affair.But the Grampians is worth the drive from Melbourne. The stunning surrounds are a must-see and the feeling that the flaws are soon to be improved upon make it one for the to-do list.Steel Cutters CottageThis newly restored two-bedroom cottage on the main street of Great Western is a home away from home, with one of the best self-catering kitchens I've ever cooked in and a delicious breakfast from a hamper of local ingredients.Owners Rohan and Marlene Erard, and the neighbours on both sides hanging out their Saturday morning wash in their nighties, added to the homely feel.Rate: peak of $560/two nights on long weekends and special events; $180/night on normal weekends; $160/night during the week. Higher rates for more than one couple.Aspect VillasAfter our two and a bit hour walk to The Pinnacle, a rocky outcrop in the Wonderland walking area near Halls Gap, the sight of the deep spa bath next to a window looking out to bushland was perfect.There are views of mountains from almost every room of the two villas on the 10-hectare property, ensuring plenty of privacy and room for kangaroos to roam.Rate: $750/two nights on weekendsRoyal Mail Hotel, DunkeldThe spacious walk-in shower and Appelles Apothecary bathroom products at the hotel were luxurious and we slept soundly on the king-size bed. The hotel also has cottages nearby for families and pets.Rate: peak of $340/night on weekends and special events; $295/night during the week. JGThe writer was a guest of Grampians Tourism", "AFR_1052": "News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch has invoked his grandfather's reporting of Gallipoli to lash the Abbott government's new national security laws that could jail journalists for up to 10 years.Mr Murdoch said Australia's press freedom was under threat and had already fallen dramatically by world standards.\"It might surprise you that today Australia ranks 33rd, just behind Belize, on the Freedom House index. Twenty years ago we ranked 9th,\" Mr Murdoch said during the Keith Murdoch Oration at the State Library in Melbourne on Thursday night.Mr Murdoch said the government was frequently asking Australians to trust them when attempting to censor the media.\"But trust is something that should not be a consideration when restricting our fundamental freedoms. Our freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not things we should blindly entrust anyone.\"Mr Murdoch singled out the government's national security laws that could jail journalists for up to 10 years for revealing \"special intelligence operations\".Many, including human rights commissioner Tim Wilson, have condemned these laws, saying they would restrict legitimate scrutiny of Australia's secret agencies.Mr Murdoch said the government's terminology, particularly \"secret intelligence operation\", was ambiguous.\"It's left up to government agencies at the time to decide. Would the Gallipoli campaign have been a special operation?\"Mr Murdoch's grandfather Sir Keith Murdoch revealed the devastation of Gallipoli, which killed more than 8000 soldiers, in a letter to then prime minister Andrew Fisher, despite reports from the battlefield being censored by the military.\"Incredible as it seems today, Fisher ... had received little notice of the Gallipoli invasion. Would Sir Keith have been arrested ... to spend the next 10 years in jail?\"And remember, the taking of that letter , a private communication to the prime minister, was tremendous overreach by the military at that time.\"A century ago, Keith Murdoch's Gallipoli letter was Australia's boldest declaration that our nation had the right to know the truth.\"Mr Murdoch also took aim at the previous Labor government's attempts to introduce a public interest media advocate to oversee all media as the \"most draconian attack on the press this country has ever seen in peacetime\".Failure to comply with the advocate could have seen the removal of the Privacy Act exemptions, which \"are essential for journalists to do their work,\" Mr Murdoch said. \"And, if all else failed, a single unnamed 'super expert' could apply his or her own undefined 'public interest test' and punish an organisation commercially.\"\"Censorship should be resisted in all its insidious forms. We should be vigilant of the gradual erosion of our freedom to know, to be informed and make reasoned decisions in our society and in our democracy. We must all take notice and, like Sir Keith, have the courage to act when those freedoms are threatened.\"", "AFR_1051": "The Abbott government wants to force telecommunications companies such as Telstra and SingTel-Optus to store detailed information about the calls and internet use of its customers for two years.Metadata can include everything from the time, location and duration of phone calls to detailed information about Facebook posts and tweets as well as the type of devices used.The government wants to store metadata, which would then be used by spy agencies and policing bodies for investigative purposes.But Attorney-General George Brandis did not reveal the level of detail it wants the data to include.Civil libertarians said the move was a massive breach of privacy while the telecommunications industry has claimed it could cost between $500 million and $600 million to implement, depending on the type of data recorded. Perth-based internet service provider iiNet said this could lead to customers paying an \"internet tax\" of $5 to $10 extra per month for their services.Senator Brandis told journalists the government was still discussing who would pay the cost of bringing the plan to life.\"The data retention laws will come in, if you like, as the third tranche if the agency powers legislation can be regarded as the first tranche,\" he said.\"The question of the cost is something that the government is currently in discussion with the telcos.\"Full public debate neededThe government's national security committee agreed to back the new laws on Monday night.They will be taken to Parliament later this year with an interim data retention measure to be introduced as early as September.But Australian Greens senator Scott Ludlam said he would continue to fight the measures.\"They've just picked a fight with the internet,\" he said. \"The last two times data retention were put on the table as a serious proposition it sparked a very serious campaign and this time will be no different.\"They need to tell the telcos what material they're going to force them into recording ... and we'll eventually see where the different parties stand to see whether or not the government has the numbers to carry it off.\"Labor supported data retention while in government but has changed tack since the Coalition took power in 2013. It has since said it wants a full public debate on the issue and will reserve its decision until after it sees the proposal in Parliament.iiNet chief regulatory officer Steve Dalby said his company's calculations of the potential cost implications were based on the definitions of metadata included in a confidential briefing paper sent by the Attorney- General's office.Mr Dalby said storing the data would cost his company alone around $100 million.", "AFR_1074": "There's more to this pocket of establishment than its history and high-profile residents, writes Samantha Hutchinson.At the confluence of the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, the peninsula of Hunters Hill could have been Sydney's best-kept secret.But the suburb's tree-lined streets and colonial architecture have made it a magnet for the high powered and high profiled. Tucked well away from major arterial roads, it offers a rare combination of water views and privacy, all within nine kilometres of the city.While the suburb's mix of waterfront property and pretty local shops and cafes are charming, Hunters Hill's grand old homes - many built from local sandstone - are considered its greatest asset.Sandstone residences built in the Georgian, Victorian and Federation style account for the majority of homes lining the streets that slope down to the water, making the area a natural choice for wealthy residents looking for peace and quiet in opulent surroundings.Hunters Hill may offer an attractive combination of views, peace and a village atmosphere, but buyers are definitely forced to pay for it.The median sales prices for detached homes has averaged over $1.5 million for the past five years, while waterfront properties on Crescent Street, Le Vesinet Drive and Viret Street are known to easily stretch above $10 million.Actress Cate Blanchett has called the suburb home for about seven years, while former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray and federal Treasurer Joe Hockey are long-time residents.Comedian Tim Ross and his wife Michelle are also residents, having picked up one of the few examples of modern architecture in the area, a renovated home built in the late 1950s.Aside from the power-brokers, Hunters Hill is dominated by families with young children. Kids under 14 are the most dominant age group in the area, while more than two-thirds of households are owner-occupied.Buyers looking for sandstone and history will be spoilt for choice in the tree-lined streets branching off from Church and Alexandra streets and Woolwich Road, which run down the spine of the peninsula.Those looking for a waterfront are more likely to find their dream home in quiet, private dead-ends including Le Vesinet Drive and Viret Street. In some cases, they might strike it lucky and get the best of both worlds.A gracious French provincial-inspired home at 3 Sea Street has four bedrooms and a level lawn stretching out to a swimming pool and barbecue area, and a private jetty and pontoon.The north-facing home has french doors, colonnaded verandahs, parquetry flooring and a four-car garage.It is scheduled to go to auction on March 15, with expectations above $5.5 million.Savills agent Adam Ross and Bresic Whitney agent Nicholas McEvoy hold the listing.Weigh it up Pros Quiet, leafy streets Opulent homes Local shopping strip Cons Expensive Congested streets Tightly held Low turnover", "AFR_1000": "The Abbott government's farm land register has been delayed because of technical difficulties in collecting the information and concerns about the register's potential to fan anti-foreign investment sentiment during sensitive trade talks with China.The Coalition promised in the 2013 election to introduce a register of foreign ownership of rural land, along with lower thresholds for Foreign Investment Review Board scrutiny of foreign acquisitions of farm land and agribusinesses.Government sources expect the new regulations setting out the Coalition's $15 million Foreign Investment Review Board approval threshold for agricultural land purchases, and $53 million for agribusiness could be announced within weeks, as early as the end of the financial year.But the land register, first proposed by former prime minister Julia Gillard in 2012 and championed by the National Farmer' Federation and rural Coalition MPs, has proved problematic.A spokesperson for Treasurer Joe Hockey said: \"We are working on the detail to establish an agricultural land register and there will be an announcement in due course\".Treasury is still grappling with how to define a \"foreign person\", because the Foreign Investment Review Board definition of foreign person is so broad that even businesses, or trusts, that are majority Australian owned could be classed as a foreign person.Foreign investment experts familiar with Treasury's deliberations said there was the risk that making the definition too broad, giving a misleading impression of foreign ownership in Australia, could encourage a xenophobic reaction in some sections of the community.The government is also cognisant that, amid controversy over Chinese investors buying up residential properties in the metropolitan cities, there is also a government inquiry ito foreign investment in residential property due to report at the end of the year. One option is to have the register administered by the Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs, under Trade minister Andrew Robb, instead of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which currently collects patchy and irregular surveys of foreign investment.The register will not be entirely transparent; the database is unlikely to be \"searchable\" by individual investors to preserve commercial confidentiality and individual privacy.There will be disclosure by country of origin, but it is likely to be an annual or semi-annual ranking, rather than a week-by-week update of land sales.The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed 89 per cent of agricultural land as entirely Australian owned, a further 5.5 per cent at least 50 per cent Australian owned.Complicating matters, Queensland already has its own foreign-owned agricultural land register and the Treasury is struggling to merge the data from Queensland and the other state and territory land titles offices ito a single coherent database.An Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences' report in 2012 found 1 per cent of agricultural businesses by number, 11.3 per cent of farmland and 9 per cent of water entitlements have some foreign ownership. That report found foreigners own 50 per cent of wheat exporters; 50 per cent of milk processing; 60 per cent of raw sugar milling; and 40 per cent of beef production. It said Australia was 10th most restrictive for foreign direct investment in agriculture out of 34 OECD members.", "AFR_1020": "Knowledge is no longer important, but it is constant learning and applying the learning which is becoming more important.In 2012, people took 380 billion snaps, but Kodak went bankrupt. The same year, people spent $114 billion on books, but Borders closed.Both of these organisations were run by experienced executives with MBAs educated at elite business schools. They had \"knowledge\" of digital impacts on their respective businesses such as Instagram and Amazon, but failed to apply this to transforming their business models.Digits are winning over widgets and the list of early winners and losers are growing.Every click, swipe, comment, deposit , purchase, claims or search produces information that adds up to form a unique virtual identity. There exist auras or halos of data around individuals, but also around devices and organisations.Contemporary organisations, irrespective of their size, need to take intuition out of their decision-making if they want to survive, and make smarter decisions based on increasingly incisive data insights.The cycle of analysis, challenge, and change backed by data-driven insights will test previously held assumptions or \"wisdom\" and can open the door to new ideas.Data analytics has evolved in the past eight years from a state where businesses assembled business intelligence systems from the likes of Hyperion and Business Objects. It moved though a second phase with the emergence of large, fast-moving, external, and unstructured data from various new and interesting sources, being managed by the likes of SAAS, Google Analytics, HANA and HADOOP, and then ito analytics 3.0.This last stage marks the stage of maturity, where leading organisations realise measurable business impact from the combination of traditional analytics and big data, and are using customised tools and applications.Advising businesses is a new range of outsourcing providers, geared up entirely for analytics. Leading examples are Boston Consulting Group, Quantium, Mu Sigma, Deloitte and McKinsey &amp; Co.Data is available in different forms (structured or non-structured), size and shapes. It is available from different sources - internal, external or erased. Data is doubling every 18 months and the cost of its storage is falling sharply as well.It is now possible to store all the possible songs available for $1000.It is igniting a new revolution similar to when the typewriter was taken over by word-processors. Typewriting machines are now in museums and typists' jobs are nonexistent.New disciplines and new jobs such as data scientists or data researchers, are rising in importance and frequency. We might see new top-level designations such as CDO (chief data officer) emerge in Australian businesses, who would require a background of multiple or cross disciplines such as IT, statistics, quant and advanced/applied mathematics along with an MBA.Curriculums at school and universities will need to be updated more frequently to ensure a supply of employable resources.Outsourcing is the simple way to get more from dataBut to generate these human resources with such a desired skill set will take time. Organisations might also find it difficult to attract and retain such talent. The best strategy could be to outsource the data analytics from day one.It can be outsourced to a combination of onshore or offshore organisations. The driver for outsourcing in this case is not solely cost arbitrage but is also a realistic approach to circumventing the shortage of such resources. In theory this also opens opportunities for Australia to upgrade its human resources and become the high-value offshore location for companies in the US and Europe and in emerging markets in verticals like actuarial analytics, pricing analytics and sports analytics to name a few.Selecting suppliers is a complex task, and will depend on requirements. There are essentially four types of vendors.First are consulting firms, such as Deloitte, BCG, Mu Sigma and Quantium, which advise on data strategy, modelling and business requirements. Then there are the integrated players such as IBM, Accenture, SAP, Oracle, SAS, Google and HP, who have invested billions in acquiring the tools and applications. They provide end-to-end data analytics solutions from consulting to tools, including infrastructure and multidiscipline resources.Then there are those focused on human resources only, such as Genpct and WNS, whose business is in their people, who are implanted at client team (onshore or offshore) to execute process as per the client's requirements.Finally there are the scale-based outsourcers, such as Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, which provide services such as data cleansing, maintaining data warehouses, business intelligence or virtualisation tools.All of these vendors have multiple geographical delivery centres, including at low-cost destinations in India and Eastern Europe. Geography is history for such vendors.The art of making the right decisions depends on how one thinks about and defines the problem. Data-driven executives would optimise the potential of data to survive, differentiate and excel. It might open new revenue streams (within relevant privacy rules) for those holding data, for example the selling of data by social media sites to retailers.The accuracy rate of data analytics would be the function of quality of data, integration with data sources and modelling of business rules.There are four discrete classifications of data analytics such as: 1.Descriptive (what is happening), 2. Diagnostic (Why did it happen) 3.Predicitive (what is going to happen), 4. Prescriptive (what should one do about it?)There are further different classifications of data analytics depending on the time, domain and at macro/micro level. For example: real-time data analytics - credit card fraud analytics or the monitoring of share trading or an immigration officer at the international airport.Another important classification is predicative analytics, which can be used to define future customer behaviours and spending patterns. A well-told story is the US father of a teenage daughter who received a marketing brochure of maternity products from a retailer which had predicated her pregnancy by spending patterns at shops, restaurants and pharmacies over a time period.Data analytics are used for decisions in a wide range of verticals such as asset optimisation, HR, sports, trading, logistics, legal, media, wealth management and insurance. The lists of applications of data analytics is ever expanding and is evolving as we are loaded with more and more data.In fact it has been reported 90 per cent of the data ever created was collected in the last two years.Actionable data insights are integrating the left and right brain to convert organisations from hindsight to foresight-based decision makers.It is high time Australians embrace this revolution at all levels from individuals to sports to devices to organisations to government sectors.There might be a possibility that by using data analytics Coles could have more revenue than Flight Centre from travel bookings, if it used the right models to predict holidays by using customers' spending patterns.Geography is history and analytics might be the future.Mohit Sharma is managing director of Mindfields outsourcing advisory firm. He Tweets from @Mindfields2006", "AFR_106": "Kristy Fraser-Kirk has developed a recognised mental condition as a result of her media ordeal following the airing of her sexual harassment allegations against former David Jones chief Mark McInnes, her lawyers have argued.Lawyers for Ms Fraser-Kirk told the Federal Court yesterday she had developed an \"adjustment disorder\".They tendered evidence from psychologist Louise Morrow who said \"the role of the media was a factor in the onset of the psychiatric \u00c2\u00adcondition\".Rachel Francois, for Ms Fraser-Kirk, argued that her client had experienced a \"degree of intrusion and harm\" in her life as a result of her identity being made public, and she \"doesn't want others to have to experience the same thing\".Ms Francois argued that the identities of unnamed women in her claim, also alleging they had been sexually harassed, should be kept secret at least until the trial.But lawyers for David Jones argued against any court order for secrecy, although it emerged in the afternoon that the retailers wanted to keep the names of the women confidential, albeit only by mutual agreement.The lawyers for David Jones and Mr McInnes said Ms Fraser-Kirk had only put forward evidence that related to her circumstances, not those of the women she wanted to benefit from privacy.Katherine Eastman, for David Jones, said there was \"no evidence of any repercussions\" on the unnamed women.\"It's a long bow to draw,\" Ms Eastman told the court, to suggest \"that these women would suffer any psychiatric damage at all\".\"The risk of injury\" and the \"risk of harm\" were \"all premised on what happened to the [Ms Fraser-Kirk] herself\", Ms Eastman said.Ms Fraser-Kirk had held a press conference outside her home, attended court and had a level of visibility in the proceedings, David Jones's lawyer argued.Protecting her camp from any suggestion of a leak if the names were made public, Ms Eastman told judge Geoffrey Flick \"even if the names are suppressed, once there is a response\" to the allegations \"then one might assume people might be able to put two and two together\".Andrew Gotting, for Mr McInnes, said there was no evidence to suggest any of the other women would suffer mental illness if their names were released.\"The only risk of notoriety is in the press,\" Mr Gotting said. However, Ms Francois said it was \"unsurprising\" the case had attracted intense media attention, adding that \"it's a classic underdog case\".Last Friday, judge Geoffrey Flick said twice he was concerned that Ms Fraser-Kirk's side \"has had its say\" and Mr McInnes \"in particular is at this stage being denied the opportunity to have his say\" because he did not know who the women were.Justice Flick reiterated this concern yesterday, adding that he considered the amended claim \"manifestly \u00c2\u00addeficient\".He will hand down a ruling on whether the unidentified women should be kept confidential tomorrow.", "AFR_1016": "Facebook has eased concerns raised by Commonwealth Bank of Australia boss Ian Narev that it poses a strategic threat to the big four banks, after claiming it wants to grow users rather than create new banking services of its own.Australian and international banks have been closely watching technology giants such as Facebook, Google and Apple for indications they might move into financial services and increasingly view them as competitive threats.CBA chief executive Ian Narev has, on several occasions, pointed to the \"strategic challenge\" presented by the tech behemoths, suggesting they could harness their massive user bases to muscle in on payments or other banking services. Such fears were elevated last month when the Financial Times reported Facebook was close to receiving regulatory approval in Ireland to allow users to store money on the site and pay and exchange money with other users. Facebook told The Australian Financial Review on Friday it could not comment on this report.However, Neil Hiltz, the global head of Facebook's financial services vertical, said moving into the payments business was not a focus for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook had no intention to move into banking by holding deposits. Rather, he said Facebook would remain an intermediary between its users and financial institutions, who are increasingly big advertisers on the platform.\"At the end of the day, no matter what we do, we are going to be underpinned and backed by the banking system,\" Mr Hiltz said in an interview during a visit to Sydney. \"We might be a communication layer between [banks and their customers] but transactions are going to be drawing out of a current account or a card - it is going to be backed by the banking system.\"Fairly ruthlessFacebook is authorised to process some forms of payments in the United States for games developers and facilitated $2.1 billion worth of transactions in 2013, the FT reported last month, citing documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The California-based company has 1.3 billion users around the world and 12 million in Australia.Mr Hiltz said Facebook remained \"fairly ruthless at what we prioritise and what we want to do - and Mark [Zuckerberg]'s number one goal is connecting the world. We have 1.3 billion people on the platform and it is about what are we doing to get the next billion people on the platform.\"That is a weighty enough task in and of itself to then start thinking, what am I going to do with a regulatory framework that is incredibly complex [to become a bank].\"Should Facebook enter banking, international banking regulation would be likely to require the company to hold capital against any funds held, as a safety measure.In an interview with The Australian Financial Review in 2012, Mr Narev called out the threat from companies, including Facebook, seeking to manage their own payments systems.\"Among the challenges CBA will face is the prospect, in this highly social digital world, of online giants deciding to manage their own payment systems and cut the banks out of these transactions,\" he said. \"Whether it's Google, Apple or Facebook, the principle is there: they have high-technology capability, very strong brand appeal and low legacy challenges in terms of being a historic bank.\"On Friday, Paul McCrory, Facebook's head of financial services in Australia, sought to assuage such concerns, saying Facebook was more interested in building partnerships with banks to enhance the delivery of advertising over the platform and indicated that Facebook wanted to promote the existing financial services infrastructure rather than create new services of its own.Good results\"We are on the path to supporting insurance companies and banks in making better use of what is already there,\" Mr McCrory said. \"That's how we have set the business up, we have had some good results, we have a lot of work to do, and that is our future.\"Google and Apple are continuing to eye the payments space. Google Wallet, which stores card and account information and allows users to send payments, launched in 2011. Meanwhile, Apple chief Tim Cook said in January he was \"intrigued\" by the mobile payments industry. Apple's iTunes store already holds credit card details of millions of people and accounts can be credited to pay for future services.But it seems customers of the tech giants may be reluctant to conduct traditional banking through the platforms. In early 2003, CBA launched a Kaching app for Facebook, which allowed CBA customers to conduct their internet banking without leaving Facebook. However, it was a flop, and was closed by the bank after six months when only 180 customers signed up.Mr Hiltz said the Kaching app failed because it was oriented towards Facebook's desktop application at the time the social network was seeing a massive shift to users interacting through mobile devices. \"At the people level we have seen such a fundamental shift towards mobile that when you build these experiences into the desktop site there is just not a lot of traffic being driven there,\" he said.He encouraged banks not to repeat the experiment. \"If I had a dollar to spend on technology and had to make a choice between building out my app on Facebook, or building out my core mobile banking app, I would prioritise the mobile banking app.\"Asked whether potential users of an integrated banking service within Facebook might have had concerns about the privacy of their information, the company's head of communications in Australia and New Zealand, Antonia Christie, said such fears should be unfounded, because \"trust is at the heart of what we do\".", "AFR_1028": "Ottawa Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has seized on the country's two deadly terrorist assaults this week to step up his push for tougher national security laws to shut down violent plotters before they strike.As shaken workers in Ottawa showed resilience by returning to work on Thursday morning after the jihadist-inspired attack at Parliament and national war memorial a day earlier, Mr Harper made the case for stricter security measures.Mr Harper's conservative government has been arguing for a harsher law and order policy before a soldier was shot dead and Parliament was hailed in gunfire on Wednesday, after Canada was threatened by Islamic State for committing military resources against the extremist group in Iraq.The Prime Minister has faced resistance from Canada's liberal opposition and minor parties, who have urged the government to be cautious, defending civil liberties and personal privacy.After members of Parliament sang the national anthem and shared hugs across the aisle on Thursday morning, Mr Harper urged political opponents to support his security agenda in the wake of this week's attacks. \"In recent weeks, I have been saying our laws and police powers need to be strengthened in the area of surveillance, detention and arrest. They need to be much strengthened. I assure members that work already under way will be expedited.\"He did not offer specific details, but previous efforts signalled the government wanted to improve information sharing between agencies and possibly give anonymity to informants.The flagged changes are much more modest than controversial counterterrorism laws passed by the Australian Parliament last month.The Abbott government made it easier for security agencies to streamline warrants, access personal computers and to spy on Australians overseas. The maximum prison penalty for disclosing secret information increased to 10 years, a measure that threatens journalists. News Corp co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch this week lashed the laws, saying press freedom was under threat.The peaceful Canadian capital was struck with its worst terrorist attack on Wednesday morning. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau executed 25-year-old unarmed solider Nathan Cirillo, who was guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A rifle-wielding Mr Zehaf-Bibeau then drove across the street to Parliament Hill, shelling the halls just metres away from where Mr Harper was meeting with about 150 colleagues.The gunman, a Muslim-convert who had his passport rejected to prevent him travelling to fight in Syria, was shot dead at the library by House of Commons serjeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers. Mr Vickers was lauded by politicians on Thursday and labelled a hero.The hit followed an IS sympathiser driving over two soldiers at a Montreal shopping centre on Monday. One died and the other was injured.Local Ottawa residents wearing red poppies and maple leaf-embroidered jackets laid flowers at the war memorial on Thursday morning.Many vowed to return to work and not to let the shootings deter them. Auriel Dube, wearing a black leather jacket with Canadian Veterans Military Group written on it, said he had come to \"commemorate a lost brother\".Retiree Susan Poole blamed the attack on Canada's decision to join the Iraq war. \"If we had decided, like last time, not to go in, then maybe this wouldn't have happened,\" she said.The culprit's mother, Susan Bibeau, apologised for the \"pain, fright and chaos\" her son caused.While police believe he was the only shooter, an investigation is under way to determined whether he had any help planning the attack.Perspective p18Key points Two killed in separate jihadist attacks in Canadian cities in the past week.

I have survived the helicopter ride to the North Rankin gas drilling platform 135 kilometres out to sea from Karratha on the north western coast of Australia.I was only strapped in after sitting through a detailed safety video about how to calmly launch myself into the life raft and move away from the helicopter if it happened to fall out of the sky. No problem. The helicopter manages to stays right on course, of course.So I step confidently into the sharp heat of the helicopter pad several stories of steel above the sharks regularly circling. Thank God I don't suffer from fear of heights. The water is bubbling around one of the platform legs owing to the elaborate cooling system on board.It looks a long way down. I am assured the structure is firmly fixed into the seabed 125 metres beneath the waves and the platform has survived countless cyclones with just a bit of swaying.Once inside in air conditioning, I am permitted to remove my hard hat, gloves, special safety glasses and ear plugs. Orange overalls and heavy work boots are still required attire. Not my best look admittedly. But it's hard not to swagger Tony Abbott-style as I walk into the mess.This is the tough, disciplined look of the offshore LNG industry, one of Australia's most successful export earners. The condensate and gas are drilled from deep wells, then sent onshore via pipes with pressure constantly monitored by computer operators.There the gas is chilled to -161 degrees centigrade and turned into liquid and lucrative form at one six-hundredth of the volume for shipping to countries such as Japan and South Korea. This process is so complex and safety so paramount that platform visitors are rare.So while the iron ore mines of the Pilbara are remote, working offshore is another dimension entirely. It also means a bizarre lifestyle requiring skilled people to work and relax on a giant platform in mid ocean. Like a ship going nowhere. The 215-metre high North Rankin A platform, operated by Woodside, was commissioned in 1984 and another connected platform, North Rankin B, started last year.The normal roster is two weeks of 12-hour days on, then two weeks off, another two weeks on followed by four weeks off. This tends to mean the quality of the food assumes high importance - especially as no alcohol is allowed.Still, I am rather bemused by the glasses of green liquid awaiting us on the tables. It turns out to be a combination of kale, spinach, cucumber and apple. Not quite what I had in mind for morning tea. Michelle, our friendly \"active lifestyle coach\" bounces up to say she has been up early to prepare the health drinks and that they are extremely good for us. Naturally.My thoughts turn to a muffin I spy a few metres away. Michelle, it turns out, has been there before me. She has stuck a large sign on the glass door, warning a muffin is 500 calories and 45 minutes of skipping rope. I slink back to the kale, contemplating the extraordinary changes in living conditions in the resources industry.Michelle, for example, is busily trying to sign up some of the guys to yoga classes or abs development when they finish their shifts. Or maybe just a quick circuit in the outdoor gym. Hard to beat the view.A lot of people do turn up, rather than just watching Foxtel or movie nights in the lounges.Michelle says it's difficult to lift anyone weighing more than 120 kilograms onto a stretcher or fit them into the covered rescue boats lined up outside - just in case. And there's all that climbing up and down the narrow stairs. Kale it is.After all, it may require some personal adjustment but pay rates start at $120,000 to $150,000 for kitchen assistants and go up to $400,000 for the most senior managers. There's usually around 120 people on board, including a small quota of women. People mostly sleep two to a room, alternating the 12-hour day/night shifts for privacy.Perhaps I could contemplate a new career adventure? Then I put my hard hat back on and return to the heat outside to observe operations and the signs telling me to \"look up and live\" (apparently in case of cranes and their cargoes).I ask if there are any deckchairs to sit and enjoy the view of the horizon. Nope. Perhaps it's not really me after all.By lunchtime, Michelle is back in the mess waving a bottle of balsamic vinegar, pointing out how delicious it is as salad dressing as an alternative to oil. I consider the chocolate and rum raisin ice cream on display. She jokes (rather sharply I think) that I am clearly just waiting for her to leave. Guilty.Yet few mining or LNG operations these days are without the equivalent of active lifestyle consultants and dieticians.Even on land, gyms and fitness instructors are usually more popular than bars and bar tenders serving strictly limited amounts of beer. It's working out the hard-hat way - thousands of kilometres from capital city fitness or financial centres.And it's all part of the new face of an Australian resources industry that is incredibly sophisticated, highly technical and extremely successful for the country despite the difficulties and costs involved.Further evidence that old prejudices about the resources industry turning Australia into some sort of giant quarry (or well) with no \"value add\" were always wrong - and are now simply ludicrous.Jennifer Hewett visited North Rankin this month as a guest of APPEA.", "AFR_1054": "Spaces designed to let the breezes flow will help take the heat out of summer, writes Stephen Crafti.The summer months usually mean sticky days and sweltering nights. People living in brick houses with small windows and few doors will most likely experience the effect more than others. And while airconditioners are one option during this time, natural ventilation allows for more even temperatures.\"Often people include airconditioning. But at the back of their minds, they limit its use for those extreme days,\" architect Ray Demkiw, co-director of Schulberg Demkiw Architects, says.His practice included airconditioning in a new three-level house in the beachside suburb of Elwood, Melbourne.However, from the outset, the design centred on large operable doors and highlight windows that purge hot air.\"It's important to provide cross-ventilation in as many rooms as possible, allowing the house to 'breathe',\" Demkiw says.The Elwood house, made of concrete, glass and timber, has a strong Japanese aesthetic. There are exposed concrete walls in the living and dining areas at ground level, as well as in the informal living area located at basement level.Two courtyards, one on either level, are framed by large sliding glass doors that allow the indoor and outdoor spaces to be blurred. And to increase circulation between these two levels, a 500-millimetre gap in the transparent floor allows air to pass through. \"The gap not only allows the hot air to escape from the basement level, it also means the bamboo [planted in the basement courtyard] can penetrate to the upper level,\" Demkiw says.As well as large sliding doors at ground level, including south-facing doors to another courtyard, there are motorised highlight windows on the bedroom level, located above. External perforated timber panels act as privacy screens and channel the movement of air. And for the warmer evenings, there are ceiling fans in both bedrooms.Nautical connectionsArchitect David Luck was conscious of maximising ventilation in his own home in South Yarra, Melbourne. Three large steel-and-glass sliding doors open to a northern deck at ground level. There's also a large glass door to the street that is regularly left open during the day.\"Getting the ventilation right isn't dissimilar to sailing a yacht. You need to set up a house to take into account the prevailing wind conditions at various times of the year,\" Luck says.The first floor of the South Yarra house is more akin to a large verandah, particularly when the motorised roof (six by two metres) is \"peeled\" back.\"On hot nights the roof is left fully open to purge the hot air, from both levels in the house,\" Luck says. And on windy days, when having the roof open would cause too much havoc, a small gap is left to gently release the hot air.Luck also included a large steel-and-glass pivotal door on the first floor. And on the southern boundary, there are smaller operable windows that allow cross-ventilation.Operable windows were also included in the nooks on the first floor, with one nook functioning as the main bedroom, and the other as a media area for listening to music.Architect Tom Wills, director of TW Architects, included generous cross-ventilation in the renovation of a house in Lilyfield, Sydney. TW Architects renovated the freestanding brick Victorian home and added a two-storey contemporary wing to the rear. At ground level, there is a lounge and a study/office. And on the first floor of the Lilyfield house are the kitchen and dining areas.\"We deliberately located the kitchen and dining areas on the top level to take advantage of the city views.\"However, while the outlook is impressive, the large eastern windows also attract the heat. So Wills created a \"Venturi\" effect in the stairwell, including double-height windows with glass louvres. \"You need to plan for heat to escape. In this case, heat is drawn out of the house and purged through these louvres.\"Doors to the east, protected by an awning, also allow heat to escape.\"In Sydney, you'll find people leaving highlight windows open from October through to April,\" Wills adds.Plan to cool Purging hot air through large doors and windows reduces the need for airconditioning In multilevel homes, air circulation is easily increased through built-in gaps between floors Planning for cross-ventilation is still one of the best ways to cool down a house", "AFR_1029": "A brazen new reality television show about class, money and showing off has brought six new names ito the national conversation - and is irritating the hell out of Melbourne's elite, writes Jacquie Hayes.In the winter of 2013, a film and TV production company, Matchbox Pictures, blew ito the smarter suburbs of Melbourne on a hunt for the well-heeled.The producers, using a forensic selection process, were after glamorous, good-looking women with strong opinions and lots of attitude to star in a reality television show about housewives - rich housewives - behaving badly.Many husbands took evasive action. One, fortunate enough to get the call while his wife was holidaying in Europe, responded for her: NO.Another high-profile spouse, failing in his efforts to talk down a wife who was all-too-anxious to take part, adopted guerilla tactics. He enlisted friends from a film production company to follow her with a camera for two weeks and then gave her an edited \"highlights\" tape to show her just how bad the outcome could be. She surrendered.As for the six \"housewives\" who said yes, after almost six weeks of limelight, they're Australia's latest, glitziest celebrities, stars of Arena channel's 10-part show, The Real Housewives of Melbourne, which, confoundingly, has become a huge hit for Foxtel.Andrea, Chyka, Gina - sorry, but if you choose to go on a reality TV show, we get to call you by your first names - Jackie, Janet and Lydia march across the screen each Sunday night dressed in an eclectic succession of fur, leather and sequins - the tighter, the better - talking stiffly to each other like little girls playing dress-ups, enlarging on their philosophies of life, love, career and style. And friendship - which all too often consists of a series of bitchy Chinese whispers of she said, she said, she said.Jackie to Gina: \"She said that you said that 'I don't believe anything that comes out of Jackie's mouth'.\"Apparently, viewers can't get enough.This is despite vroom-vroom lines such as this one from Andrea: \"I live in Toorak, I work in Toorak, I shop in Toorak. Sometimes I feel as though I need a passport to escape from Toorak.\"Or Lydia, who insists she's a private person but still tells viewers the details of her sex life/private jet/ski chalet/expensive art: \"I love fast cars, I love my fast jet and I love my fast husband, so it all matches.\"Or psychic Jackie's happy indulgence in four-letter words and constant reminders that her husband, Silverchair drummer Ben Gillies, is a rock star.Or Gina, the barrister sister of fashion designer Bettina Liano, who believes big has to be better when it comes to eyelashes, cleavage and hair, and who declares of her stylist: \"He understands glitter, he understands glamour and we are on the same page.\"Hugely successfulIs this Australia?Foxtel says the opening episode on February 23 was its highest-rating reality production ever, and the second-biggest local series launch to date behind SoHo TV's local drama, Wentworth. The numbers have held up in ensuing episodes, too, according to Matchbox Pictures' executive producer, Kylie Washington, a straight-talking woman who is quick to laugh and laughs a lot. No wonder, with the success of her show.It's true the series is following in the hugely successful, lucrative and well-worn path of half a dozen versions of the format in the United States, from Los Angeles to Atlanta to New York, Orange County, Miami and New Jersey.But still, Dowton Abbey this isn't.Instead, it's a show that tells us something about class in Australia today as this socially ambitious local sextet flaunt their fascination for wealth, possessions and power on screen, while displaying all manner of eyebrow-raising behaviour from just being politically incorrect to getting downright dirty.Not surprisingly, the show has had the real glamour housewives of the elite suburbs of Melbourne goggling.Many are hooked, drawn by the local content, the fact they know the six players - based mainly in that tiny chunk of prosperous Melbourne from South Yarra, across Toorak, to Malvern - or just simply because of voyeuristic fascination with the protagonists. Over coffee at Toorak's Cafe Latte or a meal at the Botanical in South Yarra, they can't resist gossiping about high-voltage Gina or hard-to-read Andrea as if they were low-rent intruders.The general view among these Melbourne women is one of despair that they, by association, are being depicted in this way.\"They're not a fair representation of the 'real' housewives of Melbourne,\" says true housewife Joanna Szabo, \"though I appreciate it's a show, and it's for entertainment. If six women were just doing the things we do - picking up kids, working and coming home again - it would make for a very boring show.\"Natalie Forsyth, who works for entertainment promoter Paul Dainty, adds: \"It's cringeworthy but I'm addicted to watching. I've watched every episode.\"Other Melbourne girlfriends, who won't be named, have said things such as: \"Why do these girls think they can get away with wearing those scaly things that pass for dresses? Move on!\"From another: \"I'm embarrassed to say I live in Toorak because of that stupid show.\"And another, with an even sharper tongue, about psychic Jackie: \"She's not even from Melbourne; she's from Newcastle! And who cares about the 'international rock star' husband. I mean, who is Silverchair, anyway? And she doesn't even own that house in Hawthorn. They're renters.\"Ahem. Or rather. Reeoooww! This is the real Melbourne. It isn't inclined to be charitable when its reputation takes a hit.Car-crash curiositySome say they quit watching the show after the first few episodes but others are threatening to start watching to see what the fuss is about. All this chatter has created a broader audience than the show might otherwise have attracted. People want to be part of the conversation, which may well be part of the Real Housewives franchise's secret. This is car-crash curiosity, pure and simple, about places and people that seem familiar.The teaser lines that opened the show went like this: \"When it comes to style and glamour, Melbourne is the jewel in Australia's crown. Handle yourself right, and doors will open on another world.\"Be afraid, in that case.The self-promotion is astounding; the attempts to look rich, gauche; the gaudiness, one-upmanship and bitchy cattiness plain exhausting.Asked about Melbourne's wrath about the show's snarkiness, Matchbox's Washington laughs and says if we think that what we're seeing isn't normal, think again.\"I think this stuff happens, but people don't acknowledge it,\" she says. \"People say these things to each other. We did not produce these women. And it's not scripted.\"It's not like just six of these women exist in Melbourne. There are a lot more, way more. So I think people are kidding themselves to be shocked at it.\"Four-and-a-half years ago, I moved to Melbourne and the Real Housewives are nothing like the people I've met since arriving here. And I live in Toorak, the centrepiece of the show but, in reality, a suburb known for its old money, discretion and conservatism. People here are generally polite, kind and understated, and they treat money as a dirty word. If it's on display, it's often out of generosity.Can Melbourne recover from the Real Housewives?Of course it can. This \"most liveable city\" is steeped in culture, elegance and refinement. Manners matter here, and a culture of discreet philanthropy has been well established. It's a long way from those cities depicted in the US shows.An friend in Orange County, California, accustomed to spending time with the sorts of women who appear in the US versions, says their main motivation for signing on \"is a desperate need for their 15 minutes of fame: they're fundamentally insecure and they've been in the shadows of their successful, high-profile husbands. This is their time.\"As for those who watch it: \"They enjoy seeing people humiliated, debased and exposed for being less impressive than they make out. It makes them [viewers] feel somehow better about where they're at themselves,\" he says.Which sounds suspiciously like Tall Poppy Syndrome to me, a well-established part of Australia's DNA.Self-promotionPlenty of people I know are wondering why anyone would put themselves on display the way these local women have. It certainly couldn't have been for the $25,000 appearance fee they received, given how much they clearly spend already on their lavish lifestyles and wardrobe requirements.Matchbox repeatedly approached several of my school-mum friends with kids at prestigious private Melbourne schools, asking them to take part. But they declined; they weren't, in polite-speak, those types of girls. In some instances, their husbands - in finance, law and medicine - wouldn't allow it. In others, it was about privacy.\"I just don't think there's any upside in doing it,\" one leggy former model said. \"Matchbox said it would be great for me 'to market my brand'. I said, 'I don't have a brand, but if I develop one overnight, I'll get back to you'. I don't want to be a laughing stock of Melbourne.\"Is that what the women of the Real Housewives of Melbourne have become? \"Yes,\" she replies firmly. \"In the circles of people I move with, yes, they definitely are.\"Not that the new celebs care about that because they're laughing all the way to the bank, according to what they told me at a Mercedes-Benz function the other week. Andrea Moss and Chyka Keebaugh were very clear they did the show solely for the promotion of their businesses: the former in skincare, and the latter, with The Big Group, in catering and event management.It's worked. A blowout in demand since the show's promotion began last year has encouraged both women to expand their offerings. Chyka has put on hold plans to open a shop in Abu Dhabi because of commercial and cultural difficulties but, in the meantime, is exploring other market opportunities that have emerged.\"We've been getting inquiries from a much broader audience about all kinds of areas of hospitality which we might never have considered but are certainly open to now,\" she says.Meanwhile, Moss's Liberty Belle Skincare Centre in Toorak has doubled in size, with a well-timed opening of a new skincare facility in October already at capacity.\"I couldn't care less about what people think of me personally,\" says Moss, who speaks in person as she does on screen, with very deliberate pronunciation. \"It was all about Liberty Belle. I also wanted a new challenge.\"Next, she'd like to move ito film production, and plans to self-publish a book of advice she's written for mums who want to stay in the workforce, called The Working Mum's Revenge. (This irritates the true housewives of Melbourne, who can't forget Moss's revelation in episode one about having five nannies. One is for the dog.)Jackie Gillies's co-stars say she's got people lining up to seek her other-worldly wisdom - three years' worth of people, apparently. Which will have her sitting pretty, given she charges $495 for each 30-minute session, according to her online booking page.Oh, and barrister Liano is planning to launch a line of shoes - embellished, of course, like the towering stilettos she's never without on the show.Who's next?Executive producer Washington says Melbourne was chosen over perhaps more obvious city choices such as Sydney or the Gold Coast because of its classier, more tight-knit community.\"It's a different show in Melbourne with all the alleyways, and being shot in winter with the furs and leather, it had a totally different feel. I think that paid off because it was a little more unexpected, more atmospheric.\"There is talk of another season, though nothing is yet confirmed. Positive reaction to the Australian show on US cable channel Bravo makes things more promising. Which will dismay those from the elegant end of town who just want it to go away. That includes the CEO of a high-profile luxury Australian brand, who sent me a note the other week echoing what many others are thinking: \"These people neither reflect Melbourne nor understand what real class or real luxury is. The sooner the show dies, the better.\"Unless things go absolutely pear-shaped this weekend, while the real housewives are filming their two \"reunion\" episodes, it's unlikely to do so. The original show out of Orange County will have run to nine seasons when it goes to air next month.Get your armour on, Sydney. I hear you're next.", "AFR_100": "Companies are considering jettisoning the old standby in favour of more popular mobile devices, write Brian Corrigan and Paul Smith.A fierce smartphone war is set to ignite for Australian corporate customers as the growing popularity of devices such as Apple's iPhone and HTC's Desire weakens the iron grip of the BlackBerry.The Australian Financial Review can reveal that key corporate technology players, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Woolworths, are planning to tear up their \"BlackBerry only\" enterprise policies, and have begun trials of Apple's iPhone 4 with a view to making them available to staff within the next year.The trials come as businesses look for ways to harness the increasing number of mobile devices and tablet computers used by staff in their personal lives, to cut costs and improve productivity.The escalating smartphone battles have been highlighted in the past week after traditional market leader Nokia replaced its long-standing chief executive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, with former Microsoft executive Stephen Elop, and jettisoned the head of its smartphone business, Anssi Vanjoki, who had served the company for 19years. Nokia has yet to find a way of capturing the imagination of customers lured to the iPhone.Microsoft also faces one of the biggest \u00c2\u00adbattles in its history later this year when it attempts to re-establish itself in the smartphone market with the launch of its Windows Phone 7 mobile operating system. Tracey Fellows, Microsoft's managing director of Australia and New Zealand, earlier this month admitted that a lack of innovation had caused the company to fall well off the pace of its nimbler rivals.In the Australian market, business customers don't come much bigger than Commonwealth Bank of Australia. For smartphone suppliers, the bank is prized territory, which has been held until now by Research In Motion's BlackBerry. The CBA's chief information officer, Michael Harte, said significant demand from the bank's staff led to him initiating a trial of iPhones, which would focus largely on security problems associated with the devices.Mr Harte said: \"There is a significant demand for those devices because from a consumer point of view, the accessibility and convenience is very high. They have great graphics and are very easy to use. There are two security issues that haven't been properly rectified - the first is the ability to immobilise or close the account should the employee lose the device; and the second is related to the Citibank privacy breach in the United States.\"In late July, Citibank admitted its iPhone application accidentally stored personal user data, including account numbers in a secret directory on the iPhone.Mr Harte said CBA's trial was being conducted across a variety of different users so it could ascertain the security and convenience of the device, and perform a thorough cost-benefit analysis.\"The cost of provisioning is something we have to weigh up. We already have provision for other PDAs [personal digital assistant] including mobiles and BlackBerrys. To add another one is an additional cost, even though it is not prohibitive,\" he said. \"But the demand is there and, assuming we resolve our security concerns, we are looking at next calendar year for full production.\"Mr Harte said one issue raised so far in trials was the iPhone's touch-screen keyboard was not that great for long emails. Some users experienced \"fat finger\" issues, meaning it was not that easy to type a long message whereas, Mr Harte said, the traditional \"qwerty\" keyboard on the BlackBerry tended to be a little more user-friendly.The CBA is looking at loosening up its approach to smartphones, alongside a separate plan to initiate a \"BYO\" information technology strategy. Echoing a plan floated by Department of Defence chief information officer, Greg Farr, in June, the out-of-work technology purchases of CBA staff could be incorporated into their corporate life.Mr Harte said: \"At the moment we supply all the devices but increasingly, both in laptop, tablet, PC and PDA, if people want to bring their own, we are going to be provisioning for that and that will also be from next year.\"Woolworths' chief information officer, Daniel Beecham, has initiated similar trials, looking at how Apple's iPhone and iPad tablet device could be incorporated into its technology.Woolworths' spokesman, Luke Schepen, said the trial was very small and focused on allowing staff access to their email and calendar information. He said, \"iPhones and other smartphones have become a basic commodity of life for many. It is a quite simple concept to see how we might make it easier for our employees to do their work. It is simple, it is smart and it's good business.\"\"Obviously there is a wide variety of smartphones on the market so we would have a look at all devices eventually. There are some basic fundamentals that need to be in place in terms of agreements with those people that use them, in order to cover off security and proper use.\"The challenge to the BlackBerry has already been felt in some smaller enterprises. Road freight operator Star Track Express previously had senior executives and national managers using BlackBerry smartphones, but replaced them with iPhones in November. It now has 300 staff, from senior executives to account managers, using the Apple device.\"We looked at ease of use and didn't want to mix smartphones,\" Star Track's director of information technology Max Robson said. \"Where we have taken BlackBerrys away, people are not unhappy at all.\"Lion Nathan National Foods has more than 800 iPhones across its business. Its chief information officer, Darryl Warren, said it had been a very early adopter and was not hung up on security concerns. \"There's a lot of talk about it but you can blow the device away remotely if you need to do so and we have done that on occasion,\" Mr Warren said.He said Apple's biggest success with the iPhone had been to strike a balance between a phone that was suitable for use as a business tool but was also a desirable consumer device. \"We have never had an iPhone returned by a user saying they don't want it,\" Mr Warren said. \"We have two-year-old iPhones in our fleet when most users would previously have driven over a phone if you asked them to keep it for that long.\"Mr Robson is also evaluating Apple's iPad tablet computer as a business tool and expects to roll out hundreds across Star Track. Management will be provided with real-time information about business performance while account managers will get mobile access to all available information about a particular customer when they make a visit.Star Track has no plans to buy any more notebook computers as they are more expensive and a greater security risk. \"I have stopped ordering laptops because they cost about twice as much as the iPad,\" Mr Robson said. \"I'm not happy about [staff] having a hard drive because it's not good if they lose the device with company information on it. With technology these days, you want people to get just the information they need, at the time when they want it, and in a form that will help them do a better job.\"Research in Motion's regional director, Adele Beachley, said despite a wider array of devices, demand for BlackBerrys locally was still off the chart. Research by Frost and Sullivan has predicted growth in the Asia-Pacific smartphone market will skyrocket and, by 2015, 54per cent of all devices sold in the region will be smartphones, up from 5per cent last year.Ms Beachley said: \"My position on the Australian market has always been that it is one of the most fiercely competitive markets on the planet. I think that is great because it means that mobile data and smartphone adoption are really becoming the norm, and that is something that RIM has pioneered.\"BlackBerry still absolutely has the edge when it comes to security. It is top of mind for all enterprises and we see that IT managers are under a bit more pressure to ensure that they are striking the right balance between security and enablement of the technology to its best use.\"BlackBerry's new Torch phone was released last month but is not yet available in Australia. It has been seen by many as an attempt to counteract the growing popularity of iPhones and is RIM's first product to employ a slide-out keypad and touch-screen interface.Technology analyst Joe Sweeney, from research firm IBRS, said as well as iPhones, smartphones based on Google's Android operating system were also flying off the shelves and eating into BlackBerry's market share. Android phones include HTC's highly rated Desire and Samsung's recently launched Galaxy S.A Nielsen poll of BlackBerry users earlier this year showed more than 40 per cent were considering a switch to iPhone or Android. Nielsen figures also showed Android's share in the US had skyrocketed over the past six months, from 6per cent in the fourth quarter last year to 27per cent in the second quarter this year.Mr Sweeney said data also showed 200,000 Android phones were being activated daily around the world. The phones were increasingly being used to access work systems, often outside of standard corporate rules.\"One of the reasons why Android phones are selling like hot cakes is that when people grab a device, they want to be able to use the basic applications, like email, shared calendars and so on,\" he said.\"If those can't be supported by the office, then they will set up Google accounts and route their mail that way; users are now smart enough to do that.\"He said as organisations increasingly moved towards cloud computing, where business systems are hosted on the internet, the device used to access company data would become less important. Therefore handset decisions would come down more to personal choice rather than wider corporate policies.Mr Sweeney said the wider proliferation of different devices did not mean disaster for RIM, rather a changing business model. He said, \"RIM makes systems that allow businesses to control what is on the device and what information gets pushed to the device. There is no reason why they can't do that on other devices as the market evolves. The organisation that has really lost track in the mobile space is Microsoft. We don't hear a lot about them these days. They did have some great kit and have just completely lost it.\"Telstra's chief technology officer, Hugh Bradlow, said there was a strong trend towards workplaces opening their borders to rival mobile handset makers, particularly Apple and Android phones.He said a wider range of mobile devices in the enterprise raised the businesses' technology support costs, and that Telstra had introduced an approved corporate list for staff to choose from if they wanted to access internal systems.\"BlackBerry still has the highest level of security, but we are pretty stringent in our corporate standards and the other phones meet our standards as well, so it is not like they are insecure,\" he said. \"The level of penetration of smartphones has taken us by surprise, and that will accelerate as we are starting to see the same smartphones released at a lower cost. The reality for most organisations is their workers are going to be demanding the use of smartphones in the organisation and the crossover between business and lifestyle technology will increase.\"", "AFR_0": "Widespread pressure has forced the social website to improve its security controls as stories emerge of murder, stolen identities, lost jobs and destroyed relationships, writes Brian CorriganWhen Facebook was launched six years ago it was an exclusive club open only to Harvard students. Today, the social networking site is rapidly approaching 500 million users and finds itself at the centre of an increasingly heated debate about internet privacy.Recent criticisms centre on changes that forced users to share personal details with everybody or have that information removed from their profiles. There has also been mounting frustration with the complexity of managing the privacy settings of an account.The rise of social media means that much of what we say and do must be considered public because it is widely broadcast and available long after we think those words or actions have faded into the past.Warnings about the future consequences of posting personal information online, which often focused on what a prospective employer or an insurance company could learn about your past behaviour, have also taken a much more sinister turn.Last month, 18-year-old Nona Belomesoff went to meet two men she met through social networking. She was later found dead in bushland near Waminda Oval in the western Sydney suburb of Campbelltown.Police responded by warning young people to be wary of people they meet online, to lock profiles and to think before posting photos. But horror stories like this have intensified debate, with some privacy advocates accusing Facebook of disregarding the privacy of its users.The executive director at the University of NSW Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre, David Vaile, who is also an Australian Privacy Foundation board member, says one of Facebook's biggest mistakes has been its failure to consult widely before changing privacy settings. He also criticised the site for making the management of those settings too complicated.He says social media sites need to be more transparent and accountable if they want to earn the trust of both users and regulators.\"They are treating people's personal information, their most intimate secrets that in the past would only have been disclosed to friends and family, as if it is disposable test data,\" Vaile says.\"They don't seem to understand that once a secret has been broadcast it is no longer a secret. Once something gets out on the web it can be copied and stored so there's no way of revoking or coming back from some of those disasters.\"But he also notes that privacy regulators in other countries including Canada, New Zealand and much of Europe play a much more vigorous role in defending their citizens than the Australian Privacy Commission.Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis says her office is currently investigating Facebook and called on social networking sites to provide clear and simple privacy settings that help users make informed decisions.One of the APC's biggest problems is a lack of empowerment beyond naming and shaming organisations that it finds to be in breach of the Privacy Act.Lyn Nicholson, a senior counsel at law firm Holding Redlich, says giving the Privacy Commissioner more powers is one of the proposals being considered following the Law Reform Commission's 2008 report, For Your Information.The government has also indicated that it plans to create a statutory right of action for invasion of privacy.\"One of the difficult issues is how you define a significant invasion of privacy,\" Nicholson says. \"Government is struggling with this just the same as social networking sites and advertisers.\"The law hasn't kept up with technology. Legislators acknowledge that and are looking to fix it, but the law will always lag behind commercial reality.\"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg last week responded to the public backlash by announcing that privacy controls would be simplified over the next few weeks and applied retroactively so that users could choose to protect information and photos they have posted previously.But he strenuously denied claims that Facebook has little regard for privacy and sells users' personal information to advertisers.\"There's a balance. More and more people want to share information, and as long as they have good controls over that I think that's where the world is going,\" he says.Privacy advocates gave the privacy simplification changes a lukewarm welcome but continue to argue that users should be asked to opt in when it comes to sharing basic personal information, rather than opting out of default settings.Vaile says he thinks society is currently at a low point when it comes to awareness of and respect for personal information security. He predicts that tide will turn as more stories emerge of people being killed, identities being stolen, jobs lost and relationships damaged because of information that has been disclosed by third parties.The current privacy storm is unlikely to have a major impact on the future success of Facebook and other social networking sites, despite the Quit Facebook Day campaign that convinced tens of thousands of users to shut accounts down on Monday. However, Vaile says it needs to tread more carefully despite its size and apparent influence on society.\"This might be a puff of wind where nothing happens, but equally these mass sites are extremely dynamic in the sense that they rely on remaining cool and the trust of their users.\" he says. \"If you go too far you can find yourself abandoned very quickly.\"", "AFR_1077": "Hawthorn's demolition of the Swans in the AFL grand final delivered one punter almost $100,000 on a humble $10 wager, after he reeled in a multi-legged bet at the astronomical odds of 9972.22 to 1.Hawthorn's win, at 4.5 to 1, was the final leg of a four-part \"multi\" bet that also included punts on the A-League and golf, in various events stretching over close to a year.The first leg was picking Ricardo Santos to fire the lowest round-one score at the South African Open golf in November last year (at 41 -1), followed by backing Dustin Johnson to card the lowest score in the first round of the Northern TrustPGA golf tournament in the United States in February, at 23-1.Brisbane Roar's win in the A-League grand final (at 2.35-1) then set the scene for the Hawks' crushing win over the Swans last weekend.Bookmakers at Tabcorp, which framed the bet, say the win was at the longest odds they had ever offered for a wager of its type. The company will not disclose the identity of the punter for privacy reasons.The huge win helps set the scene for what bookies are describing as a \"fairytale\" NRL grand final between two of rugby league's most popular clubs, South Sydney's Rabbitohs and the Canterbury Bulldogs.Tabcorp chief operating officer for wagering Craig Nugent said that in punting terms, Souths were the most popular team in Australian sport.Tabcorp is currently offering $1.40 for a Rabbitohs win. \"On the flip side with the Bulldogs at $3,\" Mr Nugent said. \"In terms of the betting, that's the shortest price, longest price grand final mix we've had.\"But there's at least one Australian punter who would have preferred the Roosters making the NRL grand final.Tabcorp rival Sportsbet reported it had an unlucky loser who was riding a 10-leg multi bet to win $500,000, with Hawthorn and the Roosters winning their respective codes as the final two legs. Had the Roosters made the NRL grand final, they would have been favourites, according to Sportsbet. But instead they were dispatched by traditional rivals Souths in the semi-final.The football finals cap what corporate bookmakers say has been a strong year in the local market, helped along by the FIFA World Cup in June and July.Owned by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, Sportsbet reported that total bets for the AFL grand final were up 40 per cent on 2013, with the average amount being wagered up 29 per cent.Grand final bets prove popularAs well as conventional bets, Sportsbet is offering odds on special Russell Crowe bets, including what the Souths' celebrity backer will wear to the game and how he will celebrate the Rabbitohs' first try.", "AFR_1050": "When Esra Ogru's newborn baby was about to die, the high-flying biotech executive drew upon two qualities that set her apart from most mothers. Now she's in jail. Jessica Gardner explains why.Esra Ogru's pregnancy had been uneventful but the birth of her daughter Amina* on May 1, 2008 quickly descended into frightening chaos. Within 24 hours of the baby's birth, doctors at Monash Medical Centre noticed jerkiness, twitching and poor sucking. Before the end of her third day, the little girl began having seizures and was rushed to intensive care.Amina's body was stiff, but she would twitch, frequently and uncontrollably. The neurons in her brain were swelling. On day six a genetic test confirmed everybody's fears. A gene mutation had caused a breakdown in a metabolic pathway.Toxic levels of sulphites were building up in Amina's body, swelling her brain. She was diagnosed with Molybdenum cofactor deficiency. Of the 100 or so babies with the condition, not one had lived beyond a few months. Ogru's daughter was about to die.It would have left most mothers feeling helpless. But the 33-year-old biotechnology executive had lived her life as an achiever, scaling the social echelons from immigrant child to scientific entrepreneur.She had two qualities that set her apart from most mothers: an intimate understanding of how new drugs are developed. She also had experience running an elaborate scam stealing cash from her employer Phosphagenics. That scam had already netted her and her co-conspirator $1.1 million. It would later balloon to $6 million.These characteristics would save baby Amina's life and even progress medical researchers' understanding of a rare metabolic disorder. But they would also land Ogru in jail.This is a story of a woman with a personality so complex and contradictory that the judge hearing the case struggled to pinpoint her in two hours of summing up. She is at once a corporate high flyer, fraudster and heroic mother. Ogru pleaded guilty and a judge decided she should see jail time after considering all the facts. Here they are.Search for a better lifeIn the late 1970s when she was two years old, Ogru's parents, Sabah and Esin, moved to Australia from Adana, Turkey in search of a better life. The eldest of three siblings, Ogru graduated from Princes Hill Secondary College in Melbourne and was accepted into a bachelor of science program at Monash University. Three years later, in her early 20s, she married Vedat Isikgel.She continued her studies in the university's biochemistry department, which had a tight-knit group of researchers, some of whom Ogru would later depend on for her elaborate scam. She graduated with a first-class honours PhD.Ogru's life was beginning to take shape. Everything was falling into place for the sharply dressed, confident young woman.In 2001, then 26, she was snapped up by a biotech company that would later become Phosphagenics. She was given the grand title of vice-president of research and development. There would be more to come.In the early days, Phosphagenics, which was a developer of drug delivery technology aimed at improving the way people take medicines, had a technology platform but hadn't nailed down what diseases or drugs they would apply it to.A young Ogru was a natural with the media with her good looks and bubbly, commanding personality. From 2004 she was in newspapers suggesting the firm's technology could be the elixir for anything from better absorption of vitamins to a novel way to treat pets with diabetes.It was obvious Ogru had a taste for success. She was a smart woman who had been given power at work and she would soon learn how to use it. At Phosphagenics her star was rising.Anna Lavelle, the head of industry body AusBiotech, says Ogru made a strong, positive first impression. \"Esra was a very forceful, capable, confident individual,\" she says. \"I think you'll be pressed to find somebody who thinks otherwise.\"Ogru cut a striking figure at industry events with her shiny black bob, strong cheekbones and steely, hazel eyes. Her style was strictly corporate, usually dark-toned suits with a string of pearls as a flourish.Fake invoices pile upAs part of her role, Ogru was in charge of managing research run from her old department at Monash University. One of the lead researchers working on Phosphagenics' technology was her former PhD supervisor, Robert Gianello.Ogru realised her old friend was doing unpaid overtime on research for her firm, so she suggested he set up a company that could charge a Phosphagenics subsidiary for work he did outside normal hours. The respected academic set up Bynex Research Services and at first he would just be paid a little sweetener for the overtime.The arrangement soon changed, however, and Ogru began creating fake invoices for projects undertaken by Bynex. She would approve the invoices and the money would be split between the two. Emails read out in court suggest Ogru had a strong sense of entitlement. \"We work hard and we deserve it. Enjoy it,\" she wrote to Gianello.Gianello, twice married with two adult sons from his first wife and a primary school-aged boy from his current wife, in court sought to justify his involvement based on the \"force\" of Ogru's personality. He was also upset that university researchers are paid less than their peers in the private sector.Between November 2004 and April 2008, 44 false invoices submitted by Bynex reaped $1.1 million. Ogru received $510,215, Gianello $577,597. The money was mostly used to pay down their mortgages and improve their lifestyles.In 2005, the same year that Osru joined the Phosphagenics board, she bought a large house in Wheelers Hill in the south-east outskirts of Melbourne. The three-storey home with a pool had views out to the Dandenong Ranges and was just an 11-minute drive to the company's head office in a business park in Clayton. Within two years the balance on her mortgage with Bendigo Bank was just $5449.Spendthrift scientistNone of this seemed enough for Ogru, who began supplementing the false invoice scam by using her credit card for personal purchases then claiming the money back from the company. Between 2006 and 2013 she racked up more than $400,000 on jewellery, $220,000 on clothing, $50,000 on duty free and department store purchases and almost $400,000 in transactions for household expenses.Meanwhile, Phosphagenics was making progress with its technology, confirming its effectiveness in creams to fight acne and ageing, as well as beginning clinical trials investigating its use in pain relief.The invoice scam went undetected until early 2008 when Phosphagenics' chief financial officer, Alister Hodges, realised that Bynex was Gianello's company. He raised it with Ogru, who lied and said the services provided by Bynex were carried out by Gianello's wife, Louise.Ogru and Gianello tried setting up new companies but again these were queried by the finance head. The persuasive Ogru allayed the concerns of Hodges, who didn't take the issue further, but emails between Ogru and Gianello appear to acknowledge the scam had come to a close.Ogru was 32 years old. She was a few months away from having her first child, owned a nice house and was cementing her reputation in the sector. She could have counted her lucky stars and ended the fraud. She didn't.By chance Ogru ran into Woei-Jia Jiang, a friend from the Monash biochemistry department who had finished his PhD in 1999. With Gianello, Ogru met with Jiang to discuss a legitimate business opportunity whereby the Taiwan-born scientist could introduce Phosphagenics to overseas-based research partners. The discussions quickly turned to how the trio could profit illegitimately from the partnership.But just as Ogru was masterminding another clever scheme, the woman so seemingly in control was knocked sideways.Shaken by a babyThe birth of Amina, at 37 weeks, was supposed to be the next stage of her already successful life. But it changed everything.After learning of the heartbreaking diagnosis of Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD), which meant her first daughter would live a short life, Ogru sprang into action. Through her scientific networks, helped especially by Gianello, she came across Professor Guenter Schwarz in Cologne, Germany who had made a compound he thought could treat the disorder. But it had only been tested on animals.Schwarz had developed an animal model of MoCD by breeding mice that had the gene for the particular cofactor \"knocked out\" - a scientific technique that is used to mimic diseases caused by a mutated gene.The MOCS1-knockout mice display biochemical characteristics similar to humans with the disorder, and usually die within 7.5 days. Schwarz's research had shown that if the mice were injected with cPMP, a naturally occurring molecule, it neutralised the toxic effects of MoCD.The treatment was highly speculative. But Ogru and Amina's doctor, Alex Veldman, thought it might give Amina a chance. Schwarz couriered cPMP stocks to Melbourne. Veldman got clearance from his clinic's bioethics board. But at the last minute, as Amina's condition was deteriorating by the hour, the chief legal officer of Southern Health wanted court clearance.On June 8, 2008, 37 days after Amina was born, the go-ahead was given and within an hour she began receiving injections of the compound. She was the guinea pig for a treatment never before tried on humans.Her response was astonishing - and it received plenty of attention. Under a pseudonym, she was lauded on radio and in newspapers around the world. \"Dying baby cured in world first\", one headline said.Her story was also described in comprehensive and dramatic detail in an article in the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, on which Veldman, Schwarz and Gianello were co-authors.Within days of the treatment the cPMP infusions reduced her involuntary spasms from about 10 an hour to fewer than five a day. She began drinking formula from a bottle. Claiming her cured and clinically free of seizures at 18 months, the little girl was described by a paediatrician as \"thriving and interactive with squealing and vocalisations\". But her \"cure\" would not come cheap, financially or emotionally. Amina, now six, is profoundly disabled with quadriplegic cerebral palsy. She requires daily infusions of cPMP to keep her condition at bay.Always a step aheadAlways one step ahead, Ogru, sensing the huge financial undertaking that would be required to save her first-born, had already put in train her next fraud three days before the final clearance came through.She asked Jiang to find a manufacturing facility to make the cPMP that Amina would need. On June 5 she emailed Gianello asking him to chase Jiang for an invoice, adding \"we need to get cash flow going\". Suddenly there was a need for fraudulently obtained cash - something the trio's defence lawyers emphasised in court in an attempt to get them a reduced sentence.Jiang set up a company, TABridge, which would be paid for work under a new system of false invoices. Instead of splitting the proceeds with Ogru, Jiang would take a set fee for each invoice. This fee started at $2000, but soon rose to $3000. Gianello helped but took little financial benefit from the second-round scam. Between 2008 and 2013, the fraud netted Ogru $2.7 million and Jiang $1.1 million.Ogru went back to work after Amina's condition had stabilised. Her husband, who was the quieter, more reserved of the pair, quit his job as an agricultural engineer to care for Amina full time. Ogru would tend to her daughter at night, setting up sterile, clinical conditions to deliver her 15-minute infusion of cPMP.Despite the challenges at home, her career went from strength to strength. In January 2009, she was made chief operating officer and 16 months later she became joint chief executive alongside Harry Rosen.In 2012 Ogru and her husband had a second daughter, which called for a traumatic process to ensure Amina's younger sister would not be born with the same inherited genetic disorder. She was back in the office full time a couple of months after the birth of Lana*.Ogru's fraud carried on unchecked until early 2013 when a new chief financial officer, Anna Legg, began asking questions. She alerted the audit committee who brought in investigators. As a last-ditch attempt to keep her ship from sinking, Ogru tried to fire her new CFO. But it was too late: Legg had provided a report to Rosen and the board.Ogru confessed to the scam with Jiang and further checks uncovered the Bynex invoices and her credit card fraud.Jiang was the only one to give a formal interview to the corporate regulator, giving full admissions and agreeing to give evidence against Ogru. The trio agreed to repay the accumulated $6.1 million back to Phosphagenics. Gianello, who will spend up to four years in jail, is bankrupt. His wife and their son now live with his wife's parents. Jiang's wife, who is not a confident English speaker, has returned to work for the first time in many years as a casual childcare assistant. She will rely on her eldest daughter, who has just finished university, to support her while her husband is serving 2\\xC2&amp;#189; years in jail.Now 39, Ogru faces up to six years in jail but her family's financial position is the least desperate. They will stay in their home, which had been modified for Amina's special needs, after her father bought it for about $1.5 million as part of the asset sale to repay Phosphagenics.Surprise silver liningThe story doesn't end there. In uncovering the fraud, Phosphagenics stumbled upon a surprise twist.Sensing the breakthrough opportunity in cPMP, Ogru had set up a secret company funded in part by Phosphagenics to progress clinical trials of the drug to help other babies. It was an altruistic gesture, but Ogru stood to benefit financially if cPMP was successful.The intellectual property around cPMP was bought for $US3 million ($3.4 million) by American company Alexion in 2011, but the founders signed an agreement to earn milestone payments as the drug was developed. That benefit will now flow back to Phosphagenics as trials of the drug have been sped up.Twelve other infants have now been saved thanks to Ogru's drive and determination, but also thanks to her sense of entitlement over shareholders' money.And herein lies the paradox of Esra Ogru that Victorian County Court judge Felicity Hampel tried to explain over two hours of chilling sentencing remarks last Friday.It is true that some money went to the development of life-saving drugs for other babies and for Amina's around-the-clock care. But Ogru's spending on clothes, jewellery and boosting her lifestyle never slowed.The judge called it blatant and bare-faced fraud. \"Dr Ogru, you are 39 years old and epitomised the success story of the intelligent, hard-working child of hard-working immigrant parents who came to Australia to give their children a better life,\" she said.\"When I asked why would someone with your personal and professional achievements and potential would embark upon this fraud, the only answer your counsel could give was that you wanted everything in a hurry and had a sense that you were entitled to more than you were achieving at the time.\"As Ogru sits in a Melbourne correctional facility she may reflect on the personal qualities that led her there and away from her family for at least two years.An interview Ogru gave two years ago may hold some clues. \"I want to try to have it all,\" she told the Herald Sun in 2012 when discussing going back to work after her second child. \"Make myself a well-established career person, plus be the mum my kids need me to be.\"*Names of children in this story have been changed to protect their privacy.What next for the miracle cureThe speculative treatment developed by German professor Guenter Schwarz to treat Molybdenum cofactor deficiency [MoCD] was granted \"breakthrough\" status by US regulators in 2013.This means it will be pushed rapidly through clinical trials in the hope of saving others babies with the condition.A US company Alexion paid $US3 million ($3.4 million) to a German company that was linked to Esra Ogru, her co-accused Robert Gianello and Schwarz for the assets and intellectual property developed around cPMP replacement therapy to treat MoCD Type A.The inherited disorder is rare. Medical literature has described just 100 cases. It is caused by a genetic mutation that blocks a metabolic pathway that creates molybdenum cofactor. Without this cofactor, an enzyme called sulphite oxidase cannot function.This allows toxic sulphites to build up, which leads to seizures and brain damage.Babies diagnosed with MoCD have a life expectancy of a few months.In MoCD Type A, the gene mutation stops the creation of cPMP.But by injecting the naturally occurring molecule back into the body, the blockage in the metabolic pathway is averted.Dr Alex Veldman is a neonatologist who treated Ogru's daughter.In an online video for other neonatologists, he says babies who are treated early are left with few ongoing problems.\"We found that the earlier you start, the better the neuro-development outcome will be,\" he says.\"We see normal or near-normal development in kids who have been treated on day one of life.\"Alexion has begun a clinical trial to test the use of a synthetic version of cPMP to treat the disease.It will test its new drug on four babies already taking cPMP and monitor them over three years. It expects to report back in 2017.Although the US drug regulator has ruled the clinical trials should be fast-tracked, the fact that very few babies get the disease will make it difficult to gather data.", "AFR_1069": "If you thought the birds and the bees is awkward territory for parent and child, spare a thought for mums and dads today who have to broach such things as \"sexting\" with their teen.Growing up in a digital world means parents need to educate themselves in the language of social media and familiarise themselves with the sorts of issues that may be ahead, particularly when a child starts secondary school.\"High school really represents a child's entry into the digital world,\" says Nerina Pretlove, a deputy principal and president of the Professional Teachers Council of NSW.\"It's at that point parents really need to have a conversation with their kids about how to manage their online presence, social media and familiarise themselves with the school's website and social media policy.\"Cyberslapping, trolling and grooming are some of the more sinister realities of the online world, and a world away from the sorts of adolescent issues parents may have faced, but psychologists and teachers urge parents to be upfront with teens on the problems of social media and talk openly to their children about how they expect them to act in their digital lives.\"We are raising children in an entirely different culture nowadays and, as parents, it is difficult to get our heads around how significant that change is,\" says Jill Healey, who has daily exposure to social media issues among teens in her role as executive principal across three campuses at Flinders Christian Community College in Victoria. The college enrols 2150 students from prep to year 12.\"Social media is the world our young people live in; it's absolutely the air they breathe.\"\"We, as teachers, need to equip parents to the best ability we can, and parents need to equip themselves to navigate it with their child.\"They need to ask themselves, 'What are our core values as family?' It is by asking themselves those sorts of questions and building those values into their lives so when their child engages with social media they have a strong values base from which to use as the basis of that engagement.\"Values firstShe says the best way to tackle that discussion is from the standpoint of values: \"teaching young people to respect others and deeply value other people and other people's feelings; social media can be very misused and can cause hurt and children need to understand that hurt can in fact lead to some very serious outcomes\".Robert Luzza, psychologist and director of Victorian Counselling and Psychological Services (VCPS) advises schools and parents on social media use. He says the phenomenon of social media, by making young people aware of how they project themselves to their peers and the world, can be a source of intense anxiety for kids, many of whom feel the need to constantly update or police their online selves.\"What people are creating online is a space which is themselves and there's a certain amount of upkeep and anxiety that goes with maintaining that space, and that upkeep requires a lot of emotional energy,\" says Luzza, who also advises schools on how to create appropriate social media policies.He often counsels parents struggling to deal with their children's addictive online behaviours. The most effective advice he gives to these parents can be as simple as making them realise they still hold control over their child's online activity, just like any other activity in their child's life.\"Having technology-free family time is just a normal part of a usual household routine and that means phone and other devices are put away. This may be dinner time, the last hour before bed and certainly when chores and household activities are being done.\"Parents have a critical role in educating their child in these behaviours and the best way of teaching is through example, he says.\"If the first thing that mum or dad does when they come home from work is check their own emails and voicemails and then become quite consumed with these and then they try telling their child on the other hand that online activities need to be restricted to certain times of the day it ends up being quite a futile discussion.\"Ongoing discussionParents should always seek have open and honest discussions with children about their child's online activity, says Luzza, to raise awareness of potential issues, but also to regularly check in and learn from their kids about what they've been participating in while they've been online.He recommends parents look at the proportion of time their child spends online versus other activities and make adjustments in the family routine to reinstate face-to-face communication where it may be lacking.\"Social media is a wonderful way of helping young people to share their thoughts, but nothing beats some real face-to-face communication, and that really starts in the family home.\"Principal Jill Healey's advice to parents concerned about their child's online activity is, first, to observe where their child is using devices around the home, make sure it's not in secret and make an effort to sit with your child when they are engaging with social media via a device.\"Try to be interested and involved with what they are doing.\"It is a parent's duty to make their child aware that whatever they write is there permanently. That fact has caught a lot of young people by surprise. Help young people to learn to really value their privacy. Anything they put there cannot be erased.\"From a psychologist's point of view, Luzza says the world of social networking and its relentless, 24-hour presence in our lives, and our children's lives, has created the conditions under which feelings of anxiety and fear in children can take root and flourish.\"Those fears are not so different from usual anxieties or fears that we see in children but what we've noticed now is that previously, in a social-media-free world, those fears might have been constrained to a certain part of the day. For instance, a child who feared being left out - that would be just constrained to the morning tea break at school or the lunchtime break - now these fears extend to possibly 24 hours a day because they are participating in online forums where they are part of a social network all day. And that social network is extending into every part of their day and for some people, there's little escape.\"Bullying starts hereHe says children who might ordinarily never have become bullies sometimes display bullying tendencies with access to social media.\"These children take to online to assert themselves in a environment where they don't have to use the range of emotions they use in face-to-face communication, so they might resort to some derogatory behaviour in an online setting.\"Cyberbullying, by anonymous text message or posting on social media sites, is the most common form of social media abuse, according to Rosalie O'Neale, a senior adviser with ACMA's Cybersmart Program. Ms O'Neale has more than 15 years' experience researching how children and young people use the internet and social media, and as one of the architects of the government's CyberSmart policy, has interviewed hundreds of parents and kids about their social media use.\"Cyberbullying is the most pervasive problem because, even if a child is not directly the target of it themselves they are likely to witness it happening to someone around them,\" she says.Parents and children should report cyberbullying where it occurs, keep a record, make sure you don't reply or retaliate, and, where possible, attempt to block the perpetrator, she says.Terms of serviceIt helps, she believes, if parents can learn about how a service works ahead of time and find out about its reporting mechanism. Parents should read the terms of service to learn the minimum age for membership or registration.She advises parents and children to talk to their school about any incident because, often, she says, \"these behaviours are not occurring in isolation and it can be a spillover from face-to-face bullying that is occurring in the schoolyard. Schools can play a vital role in helping to mediate that.\"\"As a parent, talking about social media is not a discussion you can have once and say, 'That's done.' As a child grows up and uses new services and new technologies it just goes on and on. It's a part of parenting nowadays.\"", "AFR_1045": "He has turned the dispatch of top-notch nosh into an art form, attracting the best and brightest. Society scribbler Joe Aston would be lost without Neil Perry.Some time in February 2012, my phone rang. It was legendary corporate spinner John Connolly on the line, adviser to the likes of Lachlan Murdoch and Jac Nasser, suggesting lunch. The venue? \"Global HQ,\" he said, aghast I'd even had to ask.The nickname for Neil Perry's Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill, on the corner of Sydney's Hunter and Bligh streets, has stuck, perhaps because it is so apt.Connolly and I had our lunch and he gave me the full rundown, pointing out the \"dress circle\" of the four best tables in the house. The first is reserved for Murdoch, James Packer or John Alexander. The second is usually home to SCG trustee Nihal Gupta or Tony Abbott's chief business adviser Maurice Newman. Former prime ministers Bob Hawke and John Howard are regulars, as are department store chiefs Bernie Brookes and Paul Zahra, and Ten Network chief executive Hamish McLennan.Connolly explained the hierarchy of tables through to the far side of the room, where you've either been seated in restaurant Siberia or you've asked to be placed out of the way. (Treasurer Joe Hockey lunches with Daily Telegraph editor Paul Whittaker over there, and company directors Tony Shepherd, Catherine Livingstone and Ziggy Switkowski, as well as Nine chief David Gyngell and rock star UBS banker Matthew Grounds can often be found there, too.)Back to now and it's Christmas Eve when I sit down to lunch with the man himself. The Human Ponytail. Executive Icon \u00c3\u0153ber Power Chef de Chef. He who created the Sydney power lunch. He invented eating - if not life itself - as we know it. I can't be sure people even ate food at all before he emerged as the greatest chef the world has ever seen.In an age of Masterchef and celebrity cooking in all its forms, there's something very fun about burying Perry and his peers in this kind of hyperbole. Australian wine writer Ben Canaider's brilliant spoof, Cuisine du Moi: The Heart of My Passion, lampooned them superbly, portraying fictional chef Gavin Canardeaux who owns Ricky's Sportsbar and Steakhouse Hamburger Grill and Bar in Sydney and whose girlfriend suddenly snips off her long hair and announces she's a lesbian.Canardeaux looked down at that severed ponytail and saw his destiny. \"Attaching the ponytail to my own head,\" he recalled, \"I went straight into town and took a lease out on a f---ed-up old Chinese takeaway and got the signwriter in. 'Nylon Thai' I called the place, and I created a menu that was basically wok-tossed fresh veg with some fish chucked in it with too much hoisin sauce, too much palm sugar and too much lime. It f---ing well walked out the door.\"Perry appreciates the comedy and seems happy laughing at himself, describing his infamous ponytail as \"one of the oldest in existence\".\"I've sort of had an attachment to hair my whole life. I've always had reasonably long hair and I used to go to Newington [private school]. In the last three weeks, the school sergeant told me I had to get a haircut, so I just left. I told my mother 'I'm not doing it, I'm leaving Newington', and I think mum and dad thought that was a great idea because they didn't have to pay school fees any more.\" So there you go, he's a latter-day Samson, I joke.\"Actually one of my girls calls me Rapunzel,\" he responds. \"My daughters say 'you've got girl hair, daddy'. Even this morning they freaked out a bit when I was wearing it out, [saying] I look like Princess Kate.\"Dining room to the starsI've ordered a Ketel One martini (dry with an olive) to get proceedings rolling. Perry goes for a glass of chardonnay. It's a laconic day at HQ. The room is bare; the sound and light are muted. Corporate Australia has powered down. While the clientele is at the beach or the airport, Perry is happy to reflect on his dining room for Australia's elite.\"It's interesting. We started in the absolute depths of the global financial crisis. There was just so much doom and gloom in the newspaper. I think everyone was just so tired of the bullshit and the carry-on and the negativity and we just had a crazy year - we couldn't fit another person in the place in the entire 12 months. It was amazing.\"Complimentary wagyu sliders arrive.People sometimes ask me, I tell him, if he has me on retainer or if I'm paying off the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d', I mention this joint in Rear Window so often. I'm not. But where else am I going to find the power set, conversing in hushed tones? HQ's publicity is simply a reflection of its success. But Perry was enormously discomfited when a photo of then foreign minister Bob Carr and News Corp executive Col Allan lunching here appeared in a newspaper.\"Yeah, one of the reasons why I don't talk about who comes to the restaurant is I really like to protect people's privacy,\" he says, swishing his wine glass about, an orange Omega Planet Ocean on his wrist.\"I know there are restaurants where if someone famous is there, they ring up the Tele or whomever, and that's not our game. So we don't talk about it, but it's impossible if you're here to stop that.\"Nothing can stop \"Lunch Watch\", I say, forcefully draining my martini glass (my point made for me when moments later Macquarie chairman Kevin McCann arrives at the table beside us). After all, it was a segment in The Sydney Morning Herald's CBD column imagined in the 1980s by John Alexander himself - then its editor-in-chief, now the deputy chairman of Crown Resorts. Then, circuitously, it was Alexander who provided Perry entr\u00c3\u00a9e to Packer, and he now has three restaurants at Crown Melbourne and one at Crown Perth to show for it. Perry also oversees the room service with Guillaume Brahimi at both Crown properties in Australia.\"I don't think many people realise how instrumental in the Sydney restaurant scene [Alexander has] been. He started the Good Food Guide back with Leo Schofield in 1984. Then he went to [the Packers' magazine division] ACP in the '90s and made [its yearly] restaurant guide big and important. And he was a really strong believer in me as a young person right from Barrenjoey House days.\"We order without paying much heed to the encyclopaedic menu. Perry goes for the King George whiting. As always, I order the Cape Grim eye fillet (grass-fed in north-west Tasmania) along with the boiled mixed greens and the carrots inspired by St John. How did one of Christ's disciples, I ask Perry, inspire a side dish? I look a little silly when he tells me St John is the celebrated London restaurant of chef Fergus Henderson.\"It's one of my favourite restaurants and I've known Fergus a long time,\" Perry says. \"We were there at a World's 50 Best Restaurants lunch and he made basically boiled corned beef, boiled cabbage and these incredible whole carrots. Who else but Fergus would serve whole boiled carrots to the greatest chefs in the world? So when I came back, I started doing them.\"Perry asks for a glass of pinot noir. I order a bottle of Zuani vino bianco from the Friuli region of Italy (hey, it's the holidays), which the telepathic sommelier already had on ice. It is blazingly cold and eminently quaffable.Not surprisingly, Perry is full of praise for Packer, too. \"He was sitting at this very table. I knew he was going to ask me to do Perth, and I really didn't want to - Perth was just so far off the radar.\"It was November 2009, and Perry stood in the lobby of the Burswood InterContinental with Packer, Crown CEO Rowen Craigie and senior executives Todd Nesbitt, Barry Felstead and Peter Crinis. \"I daresay I brought a knife to a gun fight! What are you going to say when the titans of industry are surrounding you? But the foyer was horrible and [the now Bar &amp; Grill] was a food court, so it required a lot of vision. I was captivated by James's enthusiasm for Perth and in the subsequent four years that hasn't waned at all.\"Packer isn't the only potentate Perry does business with. His partner in the Rockpool group is US tech rich-lister (and wine buff) David Doyle. When Packer looked at buying Doyle's share out in 2012, reports surfaced of a falling-out between Perry and Doyle. How is it, then, having billionaires on speed dial?\"It helps sometimes and sometimes it's a bit of a hindrance,\" he laughs as lunch is served and we begin attacking our food. \"But business is business and people expect returns. David knew [proprietor of Catalina in Rose Bay] Michael McMahon and we all spent a lot of time eating and drinking together. I asked David if he'd like to come in and be involved with us and he said yes straight away.\"The good news for them is that businesspeople are still lunching, with trade up year on year at all seven of Perry's restaurants around the country, including his latest, the original Rockpool mothership, which has relocated to Sydney's Bridge Street. All about comfortWhile he doesn't seem interested in philosophising on the institution of lunch, comfort, he says, is the magic formula for his venues. Finding this iconic space was a fluke. Doyle and Perry were planning a Bondi seafood restaurant when Perry got the call.\"I thought David was looking at something with ocean views, but it was [theatre producer] Cameron Mackintosh's offices [in the City Mutual Building] so it was full of plastic palm trees. There was shit everywhere. We had it stripped back to the bare bones and I said to David, 'Mate, this was an absolute steal. We got this millions of dollars cheaper than if the owner had spent the 60 grand getting all that crap out of here.' It was very clear it was an extraordinary space and that it had to be a bar and grill.\"I nod dumbly and guzzle more Zuani. Perry accepts a refill of his pinot.As the table is cleared, and short blacks ordered, I ask him what he does with his rare spare time. \"Eating and drinking are my two favourite things - at least that we can talk about,\" he jokes. \"We get to Sunday and [my wife and I] are like, 'where are we having lunch?'

The location, with the transformation of Millers Point and the Barangaroo project, will change this side of the city.\"Ms Lefevre said with a 40 per cent return rate, the Langham's service was one of its main points of difference.\"We know every guest that comes in; their spouse's name and their children's names.\"For work and playTo suit the business traveller, there is seamless free Wi-Fi and Bluetooth throughout the property.The Langham's business facility is also completely Bluetoothed, so you can go into the lobby and do your printing or conduct a presentation on the big screen in the boardroom from your tablet or phone.The two service stylists, Samantha and Jonathan, run errands for you or transcribe a document free of charge.After securing the supply side, Ms Lefevre engaged London-based interior and architectural design firm GA.The 96-room residence will have the largest guestrooms in Sydney at 49 square metres, with opening windows and balconies.\"One of the first things I said to the designer was 'Please demolish my glamorous office', which had harbour views.

For Facebook: fallout from a disappointing IPO, privacy fears, a dwindling audience in the teen demographic and more intrusive advertising practices. Twitter is facing its own evolution as it perfects its advertising model, and a slowdown of its user growth over the past year has raised questions about its future. \u00e2\u20ac\u2039For brands using the social networks the concern has been the sudden end of the free ride. Brands are now faced with the reality that in order to use social media and expect results, they will have to allocate budget to run ads. Like anything that was once free and now paid, there has been a backlash against the networks from brand marketers who are now struggling to justify the expense of communicating with the fanbase they have spent time and money building.It is easy to understand why there has been a grumbling among brands both large and small. However, Facebook has been building one of the most versatile advertising platforms that marketers have access to.For advertisers, the opportunity to heavily target advertising for pages, games, apps, websites and events has lead to Facebook advertising being one of the most accessible forms of digital advertising available.The launch of Facebook Paper this month has also raised the prospect of opening up a new advertising stream to focus on news and trending events. Although it's only available in the United States and on iOS so far, the prospect of using Facebook's advertising platform to serve brand messages is a new and exciting opportunity, and it gives the social giant a leg-up on Twitter's ability to serve ads to trends and events.Getting what you pay forWhat is unavoidable is the need for brands to buy advertising on Facebook to get results. Not only are you advertising to build the number of fans on your page, you need to spend money just for fans to see your content, or at least enough of them to justify operating a page. Facebook is making it harder for brands to reach their audiences organically, but, if managed well, advertising costs can be quite affordable.If you can work out how to use Facebook, then you can figure out how to use Facebook advertising. This is not to say that everyone will achieve the results they desire as there are a number of decisions that need to be made, depending on the business and its audience.Twitter advertising, on the other hand, isn't as accessible in Australia, with minimum spends pricing out most brands. However, the results from ad campaigns abroad are showing that advertising on Twitter, while not crucial, is becoming more targeted and more useful for brands to engage with trending topics and discover new customers.Twitter struggles to serve highly targeted ads in the same way that Facebook does, but this is an area the company is working hard to fix, and second-screen testing is proving it is a valuable tool for TV networks advertising to Twitter users.Facebook has admitted that it has seen a drop in usage among teens, and the average user is now in the 25-to 34-year-old age range (29.7 per cent). Social networks such as Snapchat and Instagram have stolen a percentage of users and daily traffic from Facebook over the past 12 months as a result of teens and pre-teens avoiding any network associated with their parents.These networks are also offering a very simple experience, but as yet do not offer advertising to brands, so building audiences in them requires significant expertise.Ageing demographicIgnoring this trend, Facebook still has 728 million daily active users, with an average visit of 20 minutes and 4.75 billion pieces of content shared daily. It is still the most viewed and engaged social network available and these key numbers are not falling.The changes to how brands can use it are only an evolution of the services that we have consistently seen over the past few years including the gradual changes of the algorithm.Twitter is facing its own battle with slowing growth and a drop in timeline views taking the shine off 2013.But with funding from a successful IPO, Twitter is building the support it needs to make the network more accessible to both users and advertisers and expand outside of its traditional market in North America.For marketers, now more than ever the importance of paid advertising, reviewing analytics and creating engaging content is crucial to having a social media presence.Brands shouldn't abandon Facebook or avoid Twitter. Rather they should embrace the changes and adjust their strategies to keep up with an ever-changing social landscape.Charles Cunningham is a senior strategist at ntegrity. charles@ntegrity.com.au", "AFR_105": "An escalating workplace struggle at an Adelaide-based chicken processor has resulted in the first use of controversial new Fair Work laws to allow union officials to inspect the pay records of non-members.Allegations of racism and underpayments of immigrant workers at Adelaide Poultry have been aired in the South Australian Parliament, while the employer has made counterclaims of a union vendetta against the business.Fair Work Australia issued the prece\u00c2\u00addent-setting order on October 14 to allow the inspection of non-member records. Employer groups have raised concerns about unions being able to access records of non-members, arguing that it breached privacy and could be used as a recruiting tool.But the Labor government and unions argued that such orders would only be granted in limited circumstances by Fair Work Australia. NUW officials last week visited the chicken business, which is owned by the Baiada group.NUW national industrial officer Adam Portelli said yesterday that union officials had been given access to some employee records but these had been incomplete.But Mr Portelli alleged that the records inspected so far nevertheless appeared to show \"discrepancies and inappropriate payments\" in terms of superannuation contributions, meal breaks and overtime.He said there was a '' wide discrepancy'' between what individual employees were paid, and the union might take the dispute back to FWA to seek further orders for access to documents.However, Baiada's national compliance officer, Grant Onley, said that employees were paid in accordance with the industry award or certified agreement covering the site, while contractors had told the company they were meeting their obligations.\"We believe there's been an abuse of the order and we have raised that issue with the [Fair Work Australia] commissioner,'' he said.Mr Onley claimed the union was running a \"political\" campaign against its Lilydale brand after the company had rejected a union approach asking for the company to direct employees to join the union in Western Australia and SA.He alleged that an NUW official told a senior manager that the \"only way our problems with them would go away, was if we did what they asked and have the membership\".The union rejected the allegation it had sought a \"backroom deal'' on membership, saying it had raised \"serious allegations'' of underpayments and harassment of employees some weeks ago but that the company had not responded.The dispute is likely to set further legal precedents because the company will complain about a report aired on the ABC's Lateline program last week. \"We believe the footage obtained for the Lateline program was improperly obtained, perhaps illegally obtained whilst the NUW officials were carrying out the order,'' the company said.State Labor MP Leesa Vlahos last month raised allegations in the SA Parliament over conditions at the Adelaide plant. She spoke of allegations that workers were being paid less than the minimum wage, and could work up to 15 hours a day without receiving overtime pay.She said the jobs allocated in the plant, pay rates and hours of worked allegedly depended on the ethnic\u00c2\u00adity of the worker.KEY POINTS Fair Work Australia has let a union look at pay records of non-workers. Allegations of racism and underpayments had been aired in the South Australian Parliament.", "AFR_1032": "General Keith Alexander was the longest serving head of the US National Security Agency and the first chief of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, making him arguably the most powerful spy in history. His assessment is that the leaking of secret information by Edward Snowdon is the greatest damage ever done to the intelligence services of the US and its closest allies - including Australia and New Zealand.The revelations of General Alexander in a world exclusive interview with The Australian Financial Review's Christopher Joye, unprecedented in their detail, underscores that whatever else Snowdon might be, he is no martyr to civil liberties or the freedom of information.The indiscriminate, unedited spraying of intelligence information by Snowdon is a long way from the Pentagon Papers, a brave exposure of clear-cut US government wrongdoing and deception. Only a tiny number of Snowdon's leaks have even touched on civil-libertarian issues for US citizens, says the general. The vast bulk of the leaks have simply revealed, to all and sundry, legitimate US intelligence gathering methods, the location of bases, and people the US is interested in. The compromising of these capabilities, Alexander firmly believes, will in the end cost lives.We still live in an increasingly dangerous world, with regional conflicts in the Middle East, Asia, and most recently Europe, that could all deteriorate further. Forewarning can help prevent confrontation from escalating out of hand.Such eavesdropping has long been accepted in international relations. The difference these days is that spying is not just about snooping, but includes attacking the digital networks on which advanced countries now physically depend. As General Alexander points out, an on-screen cyber attack is now a potential precursor to real shooting wars. A North Korean attack on the South Korean banking system in 2013 could have led to unknown levels of retaliation if Seoul feared its electricity grid or its military hardware might be next. The ability of intelligence gatherers and cyber war fighters to pre-empt such attacks is critical to containing serious conflict. This may all have been put at risk by the unknown amount of information stolen by Snowdon and trawled by his Russian minders.General Alexander says that if the impression created in much of the world's media of the NSA as a rogue snooper were true, he would worry for his own privacy. But US civil liberties lawyers (and one of them was President Obama) found that the NSA operates within the law. If it has overreached, then that is a problem of its political masters who write the laws, not the agency. Spying on foreign citizens and leaders, which Snowdon also revealed, is a different matter.But no laws have ever really covered one nation spying on another, and Washington can at least claim that its rules for spying on its citizens are tougher than many of the foreign governments that have criticised the US.So to the acid test. Would the Financial Review have published Snowdon's leaks had we been offered them? The answer is yes to at least some of them, because nothing stays unpublished for long nowadays. If someone wants to get information out, they will. What we would have offered is a different context: that the NSA and the Australian Signals Directorate do massive work for the common good. These agencies follow the rule of law, which means we do not have to choose between our security and our liberty. And if some accuse the US of hypocrisy by using the same snooping tactics as China, then well, since when did we object to democracies defending themselves against dictatorships? Edward Snowdon and Julian Assange portray themselves as warriors defending an internet realm of pure freedom. Instead they are dupes that have left us more exposed to a dark online world used by terrorists, dictators, warped loners, and criminal gangs who are far more likely to steal your personal data than any government agency.", "AFR_1010": "Despite a battlefield littered with twitching corpses, there's no shortage of social media chargers looking to grab some territory off the current kings of the hill.Social media wannabe Ello blew up a storm of publicity last week. But in case you have been living in a cyber cave, it is an invitation-only platform, which rejects all online advertising. It deems this would spoil the purity of social online connection. Right on.Loathing Facebook is an international pastime and people seem to love the anti-establishment Ello vibe. In its first week, the site caved under the weight of invitation applications ranging from between 20,000 and 35,000 an hour.Ello invite bidding wars were sprouting on eBay, with some over-eager individuals paying up to $100 for access.Ello is slick but a quick browse around shows its features aren't really different from that of established players such as tumblr or any other of the differently flavoured social networks already on offer. It allows multimedia posting, lateral messaging between users and an aggregate feed of companion posts. But clearly it is riding the crest of a wave of interest sparked by the adamance of its founders' stance against advertising. Army of optionsHow long that can be sustained in the face of so many other options and weight of numbers on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ is the killer question.Richenda Vermeulen, who founded social media strategy agency ntegrity points out that Ello is essentially speaking to a limited subset of people, who are hyper-concerned about privacy and feel affronted by the increasingly commercial feel on existing platforms.She predicts Ello will find it difficult to spread beyond those people and even maintain their favour.\"There are some who are extremely vigilant about their personal details,\" she says. \"They feel like their data is being manipulated, then there are those that aren't worried about it. But the divide between those two opinions is incredibly vast, skewed mostly to the mainstream who don't mind.\"While the sobering reminder that data mining is alive and well, and the immense initial popularity of the site is an impressive debut for a budding social platform, Ello isn't likely to be the anti-hero Facebook haters are hankering for. Experts are already predicting that, without advertising revenue, the site will struggle.The founders have floated the flimsiest of business models in a stated intention to offer new feature upgrades to users for a price. This would mean fonts and other decorations to spice up a profile page could be bought in order to fund the hugely expensive infrastructure needed to run a network of global scale. Most experts are initially doubtful that Ello can make it work.\"The platform itself looks like it's being set up as the people's platform,\" Vermeulen says. \"But most social networks that have gained traction have done so through Facebook plug-ins that pull data from your Facebook friend group. And Ello is obviously not going to do that as they're the anti-Facebook platform.\"Commercial realityOthers suspect that initial idealism will be replaced by commercial reality.\"No entity can remain ad-free forever and most businesses, social media or otherwise, often have to face their investors and do what's best for their bottom line,\" the chief marketing officer of social media analytics company Brandwatch, Will McInnes, told Britain's Financial Times last week.In the past few months alone, several social media platforms have taken the plunge into the market, some making waves and gathering minor support, others shrivelling to wasted websites.MigMe reverse-listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in August. The service hopes to gain global traction by selling virtual gifts and games on mobile phones. Its 19.9 per cent shareholder Foxconn Technology is a manufacturer of Apple devices such as the iPad and iPhone, which MigMe hopes to preinstall its application on.Booodl, meanwhile, raised $2.8 million in late-2012 from investors including James and Erica Packer and cruised into the beautiful, clean \"internet inspiration\" space with a social media platform that allows you to scroll infinitely in any direction and add pretty things you want to your \"card\" deck. Pinterest-like, you can show off your collections to everyone or just your friends.For all new entrants, it is the scale of users needed that is eye-popping. Even giants such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have had investors doubting their longevity, despite the staggering number of individuals on their network.The deck appears to be stacked against the likes of Ello, but credit is due for the dramatic way it has dealt itself into the game. It will be fascinating to see how long it can keep itself at the table.", "AFR_1087": "Timber, limestone and brick are back in a layered dialogue with the past, writes Stephen Crafti.After years of minimalism, there's a move to rustic interiors. But unlike many of the timber-lined homes of the 1970s, the new approach is layered with history.The Nuts &amp; Berries school of architecture, popular in the 1970s, favoured timber-lined interiors combined with chunky timber columns and roof trusses. The architecture of this period has subsided, but many features have returned, offering a more tactile and layered approach. \"It's stripping materials back rather than concealing them; you could use the term 'rustic',\" says architect David Vernon. \"There was a time when you would papier-mach\u00c3\u00a9 over surfaces.\"Vernon's own home in the bayside suburb of Elwood, Melbourne, captures the essence of the rustic mood. The new two-storey house, which includes an office, is constructed from a simple palette of materials; brick walls, weatherboard, cement sheets and concrete floors.Timber battens are used as privacy screens, as well as to add a tactile layer.\"I wanted the house to be robust, as well as thermally designed for both summer and winter,\" Vernon says.The kitchen, which forms part of the open-plan dining and living areas, is also expressed in an honest way. The plywood kitchen joinery, for example, has a wax oil finish. Timber joists in the ceiling over the living areas are also expressed, rather than concealed behind a plaster ceiling.\"I've always preferred to express materials rather than cover them up. It's also more effective if you can reduce the number of materials used,\" says Vernon, who used hoop pine extensively throughout the house. \"I see this place as a container for living, allowing it to change as the family grows.\"Architect Tom Wills, director of TW Architects, was also keen to create a more rustic and layered interior to a townhouse in Lilyfield, in Sydney's inner west. Originally a 1980s townhouse, the property had little charm. \"It was a builder's project and most of the walls were plasterboard and the floors tiled,\" Wills said. \"On the positive side, there are high ceilings and the place had a slight warehouse feel to it.\"Townhouse guttedTW Architects gutted house, replacing some of the tiled floors with timber. The owner, keen to include exposed brick walls, requested as little plaster as possible.\"We found second-hand bricks to create a new brick wall in the kitchen. Some of the bricks show old paint and even pencil marks,\" says Wills, who wanted to create a slightly aged patina in the home. \"Our clients wanted a strong caf\u00c3\u00a9 feel, with an open-plan kitchen that allowed them to regularly entertain.\"As well as removing plaster, TW Architects designed a new staircase with timber treads and timber-batten balustrade.\"People are tired of overly slick and polished interiors. You can still include stainless steel benches and some of the latest finishes, but in a more considered approach,\" Wills says. \"There's a stronger affiliation to things with history and character.\"Architect Aidan Halloran also took a layered and tactile approach in renovating a weekender at Moggs Creek, two hours drive from Melbourne. Originally built in the 1970s, the house featured poorly laid stonewalls around the perimeter. However, some of the interior walls were made from limestone and in relatively good condition.\"We restored the limestone and created new limestone walls for the entry,\" says Halloran, a director of ITN Architects.ITN Architects also added new concrete floors, as well as polishing the original concrete floors, creating a 'dialogue' between past and present. The exposed timber beams in the home were retained.There is also a contemporary layer, including a new kitchen with timber benches and a slatted timber wall that extends to form a balustrade to the stairwell. \"People might prefer a minimal home in the city,\" Halloran says. \"But a weekender, in particular, is about providing a contrast: a stone wall will always be a thing of beauty.\"People are tired of overly slick and polished interiors ... There's a stronger affiliation to things with history and character.

Anyone can pile on the kilos but it takes extraordinary discipline for a healthy actor to shed so much weight he becomes a walking skeleton.In the character of Ron Woodroof, McConaughey has found one of his most challenging roles. Long gone are the days when he was typecast as the tall, handsome guy in the latest rom com. From Magic Mike to The Paper Boy and True Detective - see story left - McConaughey has impersonated one wacko after another, and done it with considerable style. If he wins this year's Oscar for best actor, it will be well deserved, although he has stiff competition in Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of The Wolf of Wall Street.The time is the early 1980s; the place, Dallas, Texas. Ron Woodroof is an aggressive, foul-mouthed cowboy who works as an electrician, and plays hard at the rodeo. His sexual activities are as disorderly as every other part of his life. Ron lives in a trailer and spends his days in a haze of booze and drugs. It is a matter of indifference whether he is jumping on a woman or an angry steer.This agreeable routine comes to an end when Ron is diagnosed with AIDS.It's a stigma because he and his friends always believed the disease was confined to homosexuals.The more immediate problem is that Ron is given only 30 days to live.Dallas Buyers Club is the story of a man who refuses to accept a death sentence and looks for ways to cheat fate, even if it brings him into conflict with the doctors and America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In an effort to get around the fatal legalities, he turns his battle into a business that transforms his outlook on life.Winning combinationIt's a combination of two classic plot-lines: the little man who rebels against the system, and the bad guy who emerges from a life-shattering crisis as a hero.The film is another surprise from Canadian-born director, Jean-Marc Vall\u00c3\u00a9e, whose diverse curriculum vitae includes a biopic of the young Queen Victoria, and the impressive Caf\u00c3\u00a9 de Flore (2011), a subtle drama on the theme of reincarnation.Much of the controversy about Dallas Buyers Club has centred on the poetic licence taken by the director and his scriptwriters. It seems the real Ron Woodroof was not the loud-mouthed homophobe we meet in the film but a bisexual who never rode a steer in his life. His chief physician was a male doctor named Steven Pounders, not the lissom Dr Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) who provides the arm's-length love interest.Ron's partner in the buyers' club, a transsexual hooker named Rayon, is entirely fictional. But it is a great role for Jared Leto, who throws himself into the part with an energy to rival McConaughey.As the AIDS epidemic spread across the United States in the 1980s, buyers clubs were established as a way of securing access to drugs and other medications not yet approved by the FDA. Monthly fees were used to purchase medicines from abroad, to be distributed among club members.The film is highly critical of the FDA, which insisted every medication be subject to a rigorous process of testing and approval. These delays would prove deadly for many sufferers who were being \"protected\" from unforeseen side effects. It was a tragic absurdity that drove the real Ron Woodroof into a rage.Dallas Buyers Club hints at conspiracies between the FDA, the doctors and the pharmaceutical industry, but the central issue is the lumbering nature of the bureaucracy and its inflexible adherence to the law, even as casualties mount. One can hardly fail to sympathise with Ron and his colleagues because almost everyone has experienced this form of bureaucratic obtuseness, although it is rarely a matter of life or death. Neither will anyone be surprised at suggestions the big drug companies are more concerned with profits than with saving lives. The point has been made even more emphatically in films such as The Constant Gardener (2005).Super-charged performancesAs an exposition of a long, drawn-out battle between a maverick Robin Hood and an unfeeling establishment, the drama tends to wax and wane. If those moments of stasis are relatively brief, it is due to the super-charged performances of McConaughey and Leto.It would have been easy for Dallas Buyers Club to descend into soap opera or grim docu-drama. Instead, it keeps us hanging on till the end, just as Ron hangs on to a bucking bull in the rodeo ring as a symbol of his determination to cling to life.RoboCop redux generates seriously diminished expectations. How could one expect anything but a travesty of Paul Verhoeven's original RoboCop of 1987? The big budget remake of Verhoeven's Total Recall was possibly the most execrable Hollywood production of 2012, so one could only brace for the worst.It is with relief and surprise that I can report the new RoboCop confounds these portents of doom.The appeal of the original film resided in its unique combination of action, black comedy and big ideas. It was also a sci-fi western, with a cyborg taking on the role of the lone avenger. The reboot, by Brazilian director, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Padilha, shows an acute understanding of its predecessor, while catering to the need to update the story for the digital age.Never-ending advances in computer technology have given directors the lazy option of updating a classic film by simply adding more sophisticated graphics and special effects. The sweeping panoramas, laser beam shootouts and things exploding are usually included at the expense of such trifling features as plot, characterisation and dialogue.Padilha has not succumbed entirely to the CGI virus. Although the special effects are predictably spectacular, and the motorbike looks like it was stolen from the set of the last Batman movie, this RoboCop allows ample scope for satire and social critique. Remarkably, the new incarnation is less gory and sadistic than the original. Where Verhoeven's hero was literally shot to pieces by psychopathic hoodlums, today's version is dispatched by a car bomb.The close affinities between big business and crime are given the same attention in the remake but now there is a discreet distance between the two parties. In Padilha's world, OmniCorp jostles for political advantage, supported by the pronouncements of right-wing TV pundits who agitate on behalf of law and order.Vision of the futureThis vision of the future may already be found on Foxtel, and indeed, on local talk-back radio. In the film, the media demagogue, Pat Novak, is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who keeps a straight face as he praises the new robot peace-keepers being used in Iran and celebrates America's global supremacy.The only commercial hiccup is that robots have no emotions and therefore no capacity for compromise or compassion. This is fine for foreign missions, but to sell its technology to the United States, OmniCorp knows it must find a way of giving a human face to a machine. The solution, pioneered by hardheaded CEO, Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) and technical genius, Dr Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), is to get a critically injured policeman and put him inside a mechanical body, saving his life and creating a new weapon against crime.Detroit cop, Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), is given this dubious honour after barely surviving an assassination attempt by a gang of crooks. Verhoeven's hero came back from the dead, like Jesus, but the new version clings to the tiniest spark of life. The only salvageable bits of Alex are the heart, lungs, brain, and a bit of one arm.This is a difficult arrangement for Alex's wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish), who is given a new prominence in the remake. It is nightmarish for Alex, who returns to the world of the living in full consciousness of his new cyborg identity. In the Verhoeven film, Alex only began to recover his humanity after a series of jolts to his memory. The new Alex has his dopamine levels rejigged to tone down his empathies and improve his responses as a crime-fighting machine.This adds a level of human drama to a story that is cartoonish by its very nature. The film sacrifices some of the riotous comedy of the original, but invites a closer focus on the philosophical underpinnings of the story. These are the same issues raised by the tale of Frankenstein: the ethical limits of science and the dangers of playing God, along with the more profound question of what it means to be human.The new RoboCop raises equally compelling questions about the evolving relationships between government, big business and the media. Like all good science fiction it is only a slight exaggeration of the world we already inhabit. The Americans are already unleashing drones on their enemies, albeit in the form of planes, not monster robots. The call for law and order is already impinging on privacy and personal freedom.

One new feature that could become particularly popular among consumers is an application called .Now, which can be downloaded to a child's Android or iOS mobile device, and allows parents to keep track of their children's real-time and recent movements.The company said robust privacy settings meant this could only be seen by the parent, or broadened to include select family members or carers who also have a Geepers username.\"There are many potential uses for the .Now application, including for grown-ups who want to find fellow .Now users,\" Mr Whitfield said.\"However as tablet and smartphone ownership among children continues to grow, the .Now application is a modern-day solution for the age-old problem of keeping an eye on your kids and what they are likely to be doing when they are out of sight.\"Mr Whitfield said the company was in discussions with a number of multi-national logistics companies, some big-name retailers and an international government, which was keen to use its technology to help manage the chaos on some of its roads.Partners hard to findHowever, potentially lucrative alliances with major global tech players have, so far, proved elusive.Mr Whitfield said Ms Stocks had been brought on board for her expertise in the industry, and that there had been no commercial tie-up with the social networking giant.\"Twitter, like most of the big boys, is pretty strictly run out of America and I suppose the thing we are getting out of Karen is an understanding of how best to talk to them, which we are doing,\" Mr Whitfield said.He said the company was facing the same challenge as start-ups the world over, having a product they believe would be valuable to bigger players, but having no voice to tell them about it.\"There are lots of discussions with various companies, but unfortunately they are all still discussions at this point in time,\" Mr Whitfield said.\"Finding someone in any of the big organisations that can talk to us and make decisions is difficult. I would love to get to Amazon, for example; we could deliver major efficiencies to its delivery component, but getting to someone in Amazon that can talk to me and make decisions is like bashing my head against a brick wall.\"Mr Braid's appointment will also provide industry expertise for Geepers, which has previously discussed intentions of working closely with in-car GPS systems.He said the increasing sophistication of smartphones meant most could now be used as in-car devices, meaning Geepers data about service stations, cafes and tourist attractions could become more valuable.Integrating map dataWhile no relationship has been struck with Google Maps, Whitfield said Geepers was working closely with Microsoft's Here Maps division to integrate their data.Here Maps is the mapping division that was previously tied to Nokia.Using Geepers as a consumer is fairly simple.Whereas Twitter users have become accustomed to using the hashtag (#) to search for specific topics, Geepers has chosen the exclamation mark for its key prefix.Typing !Tony_Abbott, for example (if that was the Prime Minister's screen name) would list all his known addresses.Mr Whitfield said the search capability had been refined to the extent that users could search for cafes that stocked individual brands of coffee or hairdressers using certain types of shampoo.\"The actual data gets uploaded by the client, but it is a good way to get companies on to Geepers,\" he said.\"It is a lot easier for me to sign up 3000 cafes because the coffee bean wholesaler wants to promote their coffee, than it is to sell to individual cafes.\"", "AFR_104": "A Fair Work Australia decision raises the question of whether everyone is equal before the law. John Roskam reports.\"Pity the bosses\" was the first reaction to the decision of Fair Work Australia a few weeks ago in the case of Paul L. Quinlivan v Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Ltd.On September 2 last year, Paul Quinlivan was cleaning a tank in the paper recycling warehouse at the Norske Skog paper mill in Albury.On a number of occasions he was told to wear safety glasses. He refused. Quinlivan was later sacked and he claimed he'd been unfairly dismissed.Although FWA (the body the Rudd government set up to replace the Australian Industrial Relations Commission) found the company had a valid reason for the sacking, it nonetheless concluded the dismissal was \"harsh\" and therefore it qualified as an unfair dismissal. Norske was ordered to reinstate Quinlivan and pay him his lost wages.According to FWA, some of the reasons why the sacking was harsh included the employee being 44years of age and having worked at the mill for nearly 20years; he did not finish secondary school and had been unable to find work in another full-time job since his dismissal; he was married with two daughters aged nine and 11; he had a mortgage of about $70,000; and his wife suffered depression.Not surprisingly, the decision dismayed employers. They are in a no-win situation.At the same time as they're subjected to ever tighter occupational health and safety standards, employers have been told they can't use the ultimate sanction - dismissal - when employees deliberately breach safety regulations.The acknowledgment from FWA that \"it was entirely proper for the respondent [Norske] to treat seriously the misconduct constituted by repeated failure to wear safety glasses\" is little consolation to companies facing such situations. A precedent has been set.FWA said: \"Other employees of the respondent should not interpret this decision as in any way endorsing a disdainful or careless approach to safety or the respondent's safety policies.\"If the applicant had substantially lesser service, had not been a middle-aged man with very poor employment prospects for whom the dismissal has such serious personal and economic consequences . . . I would not have concluded that the dismissal was harsh.\"This sounds suspiciously like one rule for middle-aged men with low educational qualifications and another rule for everyone else.Employees who have behaved in exactly the same way in the workplace will be subject to different rules for unfair dismissal according to factors such as their gender, age and whether they have a mortgage.The problem for employers is FWA has signalled that, when deciding unfair dismissal cases, it will take into account factors not connected to either the employee's job performance or the manner of their dismissal.In Quinlivan, the dismissal was deemed harsh because of factors over which the company had no control. What's worse is that FWA concluded a sacking could be harsh because of something that happened after the sacking and because of something that had nothing to do with the company, namely that Quinlivan had been unable to find full-time work.A fundamental principle of the rule of law is that individuals affected by legislation should be able to form some sort of conclusion about how the legislation will be applied. But it seems employers no longer have that luxury.There's no way employers facing unfair dismissal claims will be able to anticipate which of an employee's personal issues FWA will take into account when deciding whether a dismissal was harsh.If an employer did try to find out about an employee's personal life, the employer would risk any number of anti-discrimination and privacy law suits.To be fair, the principles FWA applied in Quinlivan are not new. The Howard government's Work Choices legislation had similar provisions.The difference is that, under the coalition, small business was not subjected to these sorts of unfair dismissal rules.Under the Rudd government, small business has been drawn into the labyrinth of such rules.The risk is that employers will decide it is all just too hard. Many small businesses may conclude it would be easier to employ a contractor or, easier still, not to employ anyone.That would be a pity for bosses and workers.", "AFR_1": "Pressure is mounting for Google to hand over to international regulators computer hard drives rather than destroying the data they hold in an escalating row about internet privacy.The Australian Privacy Commission yesterday confirmed it had launched an inquiry after Google admitted it \"mistakenly\" collected personal wireless internet data while capturing images for its Street View mapping service.Privacy advocates have called for regulators around the world to investigate whether the data collection breached rules about access to private communications.Google's Street View cars have collected data in countries including the United States, Canada, much of \u00c2\u00adEurope, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and New Zealand, as well as Australia.Australian privacy commissioner Karen Curtis said the watchdog met Google representatives on May 17 after opening its own investigations into the matter.\"My office is evaluating Google's response and considering next appropriate steps,\" Ms Curtis said.\"At this point in our investigation, it appears that the extent of personal information collected by Google in Australia, if any, is very limited.\"Nevertheless, we regard such collection as a likely breach of the Privacy Act.\"Data collected in Ireland has been deleted in the presence of an independent third party.A similar order has been issued by the United Kingdom Information Commissioner's Office, which privacy advocates have criticised for saying it would not take any action against the internet giant.The Federal Trade Commission in the US is also expected to launch an inquiry.Taking a much harder stance, a German regulator has threatened legal action if Google refuses to let it inspect a hard drive that stored personal information collected in Hamburg. It has set a deadline of May 26.Google has repeated its intention to destroy the data but made no mention of handing over the drive, which would enable regulators to find out what information had been collected.The company last week admitted it had collected 600 gigabytes of \"fragmented\" information from the un\u00c2\u00adsecured wireless networks of homes and businesses around the world.Google had insisted no personal data had been collected but backtracked in a blog post by senior engineering and research vice-president Alan Eustace.\"... it is now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open wi-fi networks, even though we never used that data in any Google products,\" he wrote.Mr Eustace said a piece of code created by an engineer working on an experimental wi-fi project had in\u00c2\u00adadvertently been used in the software that was used to collect Street View information.The German commissioner for data protection, Peter Schaar, described Google's explanation as \"highly unusual\" and called for a detailed independent inquiry into the company's practices.In addition to deleting data and reviewing its internal procedures, Mr Eustace said Google's Street View cars would no longer collect wireless data.", "AFR_1053": "Finance On the eve of David Murray's final report, Clancy Yeates pinpoints the key issues and how they might affect you.If history is any guide,David Murray's financial system inquiry will shape the landscape of banking, superannuation and insurance for years to come. Its final report, to be published on Sunday, follows in the footsteps of the 1981 Campbell inquiry, which opened the way for a wave of deregulation, and the 1997 Wallis inquiry, which was the catalyst for the modern system of market and banking regulation.There have been seismic shifts in finance since Wallis: a sixfold rise in the $1.9 trillion superannuation pool; a sharp increase in the share of bank loans going to housing; and greater concentration in banking.How the government responds to Murray's report has the potential to affect just about everyone in the country. But, as we learnt during the global financial crisis, finance can be so complex that sometimes even bankers do not always understand some core principles.With that in mind, here's our guide to the topics that matter most.The biggest fear among banks and their investors, who have enjoyed healthy dividends, is that Murray will substantially increase the amount of equity capital the big four must set aside. This would make banks more resilient, but also dilute returns and possibly raise costs for customers.Bank capital acts like airbags in a car. It is a buffer that can absorb losses during times of financial stress, thus making the entire system more resilient to economic shocks.Australian bank capital levels were not threatened during the global financial crisis, but Murray's interim report spooked investors by saying banks' equity capital levels were at the middle of the pack compared with those overseas. For a country that relies on offshore investors to fund the banks' loan books, so the argument goes, middle of the pack is not good enough.At the same time, global bank regulators are grappling with the market perception many lenders are \"too big to fail\" and would be bailed out by taxpayers if needed. This not only gives giant banks access to much cheaper funding than others, it also gives them a perverse incentive to take more risks.One way to address this is by forcing \"domestic systemically important banks\" (D-SIBs, or the big four) to set aside more capital as a share of their assets, the majority of which are home loans. The D-SIBs will already have to boost their capital buffers by 1 percentage point by 2016, but Murray is expected to call for further action.It is argued this would also give second-tier banks a better chance of competing with Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ in the $1.3 trillion mortgage market. However, being safer may also come at a cost. Deutsche Bank says that if the big banks needed to raise another $40 billion in equity capital, it would reduce return on equity by about 1.5 to 2 percentage points. This may be passed on to shareholders through lower dividends, or to the big four's millions of customers.Little understood by non-bankers, \"risk weights\" are models used to determine the riskiness of lending. They are inextricably linked to bank capital, and this is another way in which Murray may clip the big banks' wings.Here's how they work. Say a bank has to meet a capital ratio of 10 per cent of its assets. That means for every $100 of loans, it would need to store $10 of capital in the kitty. But regulators allow banks to \"risk weight\" those assets; assets like mortgages are considered low-risk, so banks can pretend they are smaller in size. CBA, Westpac, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie have average risk weightings of 18 per cent on home loans - so a $100 mortgage loan is shrunk to $18. Apply the 10 per cent capital ratio and these banks only need to set aside $1.80 in the kitty.Other lenders have higher risk weights, so they have to hold $3.90 in capital for the same loan. The differing treatment is because the biggest banks have more sophisticated risk systems and have been given \"advanced accreditation\" by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).Murray's interim report noted the regional lenders' argument that this makes the playing field uneven. The less capital a bank has to hold aside, the more it can lend, the more profits it can make. There is a general expectation that risk weights for the major banks will be raised, perhaps to a \"floor\" of 20 per cent or 25 per cent.Any such move would serve to reduce the big bank's leverage, lowering returns.Banks have pre-emptively threatened to pass these extra costs on to customers through higher interest rates or lower returns on deposits. But there is a question mark over their ability to do so - so shareholders would probably also take a hit.Australians paid $20 billion a year in superannuation fees last financial year, research house Rainmaker estimates. Submissions from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury suggest this is too much, and Murray's interim report said there may be insufficient competition. The final report is expected to propose ways of addressing this.The headline-grabbing option floated in the interim report was to copy Chile and auction off the right to be the \"default\" fund for members who don't make a deliberate choice. This would be a radical departure from the current system, in which default funds are set through the industrial relations framework. Instead of such a dramatic change, industry sources expect Murray to suggest other options for lowering super costs. One is to select default super funds based on past performance. It may also recommend industry superannuation funds are overseen by a majority of independent directors, a move designed to dilute the influence of unions in the $380 billion sector.Closely linked to super, financial advice also looms large, especially after the recent scandals at CBA and Macquarie. Murray's interim report said the quality of advice was mixed. Potential recommendations could include better education standards and a clearer division of what is \"advice\" and what is \"sales\".The amount held in self-managed super funds has ballooned more than 15-fold to over $550 billion since the last inquiry into the financial system by Wallis in 1997. More than 1 million Australians now manage their own super.But the meteoric rise of DIY super is creating new risks as well as opportunities - and a big one is the popularity of leveraged property investment within super funds. Murray is expected to suggest this be banned amid concerns from the Reserve Bank of Australia that people shouldn't risk their retirement savings to speculate on house prices.SMSFs' total borrowings are still relatively small at $6.2 billion. But the proportion of funds with debt has increased steadily, from 1.1 per cent in 2008 to 3.7 per cent in 2012.For all the talk of big bank dominance, the major lenders are also facing growing competition from new sources: think PayPal, peer-to-peer lenders like SocietyOne and the plethora of mobile banking apps.These changes are good news for consumers - they bring added convenience and should drive down costs. And plenty of other start-ups are keenly eyeing their cut of the $28 billion-plus the major banks make in annual profits. But many are not watched over by APRA like the banks are and instead sit in the \"shadow banking\" system. Murray is keen to ensure tomorrow's financial risks don't shift outside the scope of today's regulations. The vast amount of data being generated also raises risks for privacy and security. How to balance these objectives is likely to be a key theme of Murray's report.Expect Murray to stress the importance of having a regulatory perimeter that does not curb the competition that comes from new technology, but also keeps an eye on new types of risk.Tax may not be front of mind when you think of an inquiry like this, but it plays a crucial role in determining where capital ends up.The tax treatment of property has undeniably helped to fuel lending for housing, which has surged from 47 per cent of all bank loans in 1997 to 66 per cent today.Indeed, in his interim report, Murray called the housing market a possible source of \"systemic risk\" in the banking system.Dividend imputation also lurks beneath Australian funds' heavy weighting to equities - which is often cited as a weakness in our retirement saving system.Murray has a reputation for being headstrong, and there's a good chance he will raise curly tax issues for the government's tax white paper: think dividend imputation and negative gearing.When Treasurer Joe Hockey picked Murray to lead the financial system inquiry, even some bankers privately criticised the appointment of a man who worked at CBA for almost 40 years.These complaints have been dimmed by the expectation Murray will raise bank capital levels and tackle some of the biggest problems in superannuation.But could the final report follow in the tradition of other grand inquiries whose recommendations are largely overlooked - such as David Gonski's report into education or Ken Henry's tax review?Banks and some analysts have recently urged Murray to stick with \"principle-based\" rather than \"prescriptive\" recommendations. It is assumed this would allow regulators to then implement the changes more leniently.It is also worth remembering that Hockey first set out details for the proposed inquiry while in opposition, amid a fierce debate about banks moving home loan interest rates outside the Reserve Bank's changes.Whether he has the will to now push through meaningful change in one of the country's most powerful industries remains to be seen.20 $ billion the amount paid in super fees last financial year.", "AFR_1071": "I know where Barry Spurr went wrong. The poetry professor has been vilified for his emails coloured by references to Chinky-poos, Mussies and Abos. Anyone using that sort of language warrants the opprobrium of the public. But how did it get to this?Spurr is a notoriously tough marker. Students in his classes suffer greatly when essays are returned. I was one of them. Last year I got a \"pass\" for an essay which - how to put this? - begged for a better result. Spurr's mark was out of kilter with my other results.When I mentioned this to my academic supervisor in the English department, she just rolled her eyes. And when I disclosed it to a fellow student she burst into tears about her own poor result and said \"everyone knows Professor Spurr is so tough\". He himself admitted in class he'd once given someone a zero for an essay. \"Couldn't understand a word of it,\" he said.Out there somewhere is an ex-Spurr student who decided not to get angry but to get even. Maybe it was a group of them; there would be plenty. And most students are computer nerds; mix those ingredients and stand back. If I was a known tough marker at any Australian uni, I'd be deleting my email history ASAP.The Federal Court judge hearing Spurr's complaint against New Matilda, which published the emails, says that the Privacy Act is \"legislative porridge\". So Spurr's legal action might not have a strong basis. His lawyers are also alleging the emails are \"stolen goods\", which might be cause for some redress.But why bother? The stuff's all out there. And once something is digital it has eternal life.Striking empathyIt was all a little surprising. Spurr's elucidation of Petrarch, Spencer, Wordsworth, Larkin and Lowell was striking in its empathy for the human condition. And his conviction about the important place of poetry in public life is tangible and supported by public lectures and radio appearances.The most recent email many ex-Spurr students would have received from him was one asking them to support a campaign against animal cruelty. He has a soft spot - for animals, if not poetry students.He is what you would call old-fashioned. Not many teachers wear ties to class these days. And he actually gives lectures - that is, he talks and you take notes - which were welcome to people in search of insight. (As opposed to seminars which are so popular with English departments but show their weakness when classes are full of students who haven't done any reading.)Nothing can excuse describing an Aboriginal family as a human \"rubbish tip\" or the Prime Minister an \"Abo-lover\". And it's uncomfortable that someone using that language is reviewing the school curriculum.But there is a certain type of old-fashioned person who sometimes uses cringe-worthy language self-consciously as a provocation or at other times unselfconsciously because they just don't get it.Think of Prince Philip - the Queen's husband - an awkward stuffed-shirt who in 2002 asked an indigenous Australian: \"Do you still throw spears at each other?\"Or, said of his equestrian champion daughter Princess Anne, \"if it doesn't fart or eat hay she isn't interested\".Calling Archbishop Desmond Tutu a witch doctor brings to mind the schoolboy humour of British satirical magazine Private Eye, which relishes that sort of stuff.It called Sir James Goldsmith \"Sir Jammy Fishpaste\" and the law firm Carter Ruck, \"Farter-F---\".Spurr's nemesis was possibly not just the struggling scholar of poetry, it might have been one of the cool dudes of the student cohort who have a low threshold for difference.What can you say about the indefensible?Answer: You should never have gone there in the first place.The scary thing about that is, who hasn't said something outrageous in an email? It might not have been racist but in another context, and plastered all over the media, it would be equally unacceptable. A retort, a slang name, a strong idea, it doesn't take much to offend. Sometimes an innocent \"reply to sender\" reveals earlier comments in an email chain which look insensitive or out of place.The golden rule: never say anything in an email - work or otherwise - that you wouldn't mind seeing in the newspaper tomorrow.rbolton@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "AFR_1072": "At least the opposition and the government agree on something - even if the degree of co-operation increases according to the distance from incessant domestic brawling.Labor is strongly backing the government's decision to send transport planes carrying weapons and ammunition to Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq.Bill Shorten is determined to allow as little room as possible between the government and Labor on national security issues, saying this must always be \"above politics\".Given the sharply discordant views within much of Labor, managing this requires a firmly articulated sense of purpose from any ALP leader. But it's not just a matter of political tactics. Shorten is more instinctively supportive of the US than many of his colleagues, and more sceptical of the complaints about invasions of privacy when it comes to dealing with domestic terrorist threats.The Opposition Leader's personal conviction is useful for his own credibility, given the high level of community support for the Coalition on national security issues.Tony Abbott may be having much more difficulty than he anticipated in persuading voters about the benefits of his domestic agenda or of his own role as prime minister \"fixing up Labor's mess\".Contrary to the predictions of his many critics, however, the Abbott government has demonstrated a welcome deftness in international relations. Much of that also reflects Julie Bishop's assured performance as Foreign Minister. The result has been to successfully negotiate many potential problems while maintaining a clear sense of direction and expression of values. Consider last week's official agreement with Indonesia, featuring a smiling Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, declaring a new code of conduct and an end to recriminations over Australian eavesdropping on the Indonesian president and his inner circle. So much for all the warnings that Australian-Indonesian relations would be completely undermined by this and by the government's policy on turning back the boats.Doing what it canNot that Australia can be more than an active bit player in the current global security threats in Europe and the Middle East. Delivering any real outcome from Australian outrage over the shooting down of MH 17 and Abbott's determination, repeated Monday, to bring those responsible to justice is likely to prove impossible.Australia has just announced more economic sanctions and travel restrictions against Russia, lifting them to the level of European sanctions. But given Vladimir Putin's continued aggressive behaviour against Ukraine, it's clear the West's threats of continued and stronger economic sanctions won't deter him. Russia has made the correct assessment the European Union and the US will not risk a military response no matter the provocation. Australia can do little more beyond regularly denouncing Russia, with the prime minister telling Parliament the country risks becoming an international pariah. Putin, buoyed by extremely strong domestic support, is hardly going to be intimidated by that or by the prospect of G20 leaders, led by host Abbott, telling him not to come to Brisbane in November.Yet all this has been increasingly overshadowed by the rising concern about the spread of Islamic jihadism, including the terrorism threat from Australian citizens returning home from fighting in Iraq and Syria.The political response now includes bipartisan support for Australian military involvement in a coalition against the forces of Islamic State - although Abbott refuses to give IS the title of a state, referring to it, instead, as a \"death cult\", reflecting the potency of language. That's also why Australian involvement remains cloaked in the language of humanitarian aid despite aircraft being used to ferry weapons and munitions. It's no coincidence Abbott has stopped talking about defeat of the jihadists in favour of the need to protect the innocent.Such verbal delicacy is no problem for Labor.\"What's not humanitarian is to cooperate with evil by doing nothing,\" Shorten says, deliberately echoing Abbott's language on \"pure evil\".This is still likely to escalate into the limited use of Australian combat aircraft for air strikes and more SAS soldiers - even with the Obama administration's delay and extreme caution in requesting this sort of assistance from its allies. What neither the government nor the opposition will support is any return to Iraq of conventional combat troops. But given Barack Obama's obvious resistance to any such return for US troops, this is more about reassuring rhetoric rather than political reality.Australia's enthusiastic participation in the US-led war in Iraq in 2003 helped create the unstable and deadly debacle that followed. Despite national pride in the performance of Australia's military, no one can be proud of the practical results in the country and the region.But Labor, although happy to point out it opposed the invasion of 2003, is also keen to describe the situation today as very different. Abbott acknowledges many Australians are apprehensive about becoming involved in another Middle East conflict. And most voters would be confused about who is on whose side in this latest antagonism between Shia and Sunni Muslims. But the images of gruesome beheadings and terrified women and children fleeing are far more emotionally powerful.The majority will want Australia to help. Because Abbott and Shorten agree on that, Christine Milne and Clive Palmer are irrelevant.", "AFR_1049": "Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce says Australia has more work to do on gay law reform, pointing to his native Ireland which is holding a referendum on same-sex marriage next year.Mr Joyce, who lives with his partner of 15 years, said the Australian business community and society in general was generally accepting of the issue though.\"There are a number of gay CEOs in Australia. I think it is great. It is a meritocracy here. I've been to loads of functions with Shane and nobody has ever had an issue, which is great. We should be proud of where we live,\" Mr Joyce told the Weekend AFR.Ireland will be the first country to hold a referendum on same-sex marriage next year. Early polls show support for the proposal despite the predominately Catholic country's historic conservatism.Gay marriage is illegal in Australia. \"It is great Ireland has made that progress.

He said Qantas has three women in senior management and its staff spoke around 50 different languages.Mr Joyce also hit back at racist remarks made about his Irish heritage and said Australia's acceptance of casual racism made him angry.\"In some cases, it is unfortunate we classify race in terms of people's colour ... but calling somebody a leprechaun or using abusive language about my Irish heritage is just as bad.\"That form of racism seems to be in some way acceptable, but it is not acceptable.\"Joyce has been referred to as a leprechaun by rival airline executives on social media, and in newspaper caricatures.Joyce was allegedly the target of a death threat in 2011 and referred to as \"foreign filth\" at the height of a union pay dispute.

GPs were offered $1000 to write up 100 management plans for diabetes sufferers or $2000 to write up 100 plans for asthma sufferers, within a six month period, according to the report. A further bonus was available for doctors who fit in a number of extra patients each day.The Department of Human Services, which manages the funding of medical, pathology and radiology care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, said it would investigate Primary.\"The Department of Human Services takes all allegations of prohibited practice seriously and we seek to investigate where sufficient information is provided to do so,\" a spokesman said. \"We will investigate this alleged offer further. However, due to privacy, we are not able to provide any information regarding the matter.\"He declined to say if the offering of such incentive programs would be deemed prohibited practice.A Primary spokeswoman declined to answer specific questions about whether the programs existed. But she said the company had not been contacted following the report.\"We support and encourage our doctors to seek good clinical outcomes via cycles of care and we also offer to reward doctors for their time when they help meet the unmet patient demands for health care in our centres,\" she said.Profitability under pressureThe ABC report said this would be the Sydney-based company's second investigation by the department in two months. But the Primary spokeswoman said a previous ABC report suggesting shares in the company had been offered to radiologists had not sparked an investigation.However, the report comes as questions are being asked about potential threats to Primary's business running 58 large-scale medical centres.Credit Suisse analyst Saul Hadassin has said the profitability of Primary's medical centre network is under pressure because of falling productivity among its GPs.In a note to clients, Mr Hadassin said productivity, measured by patient attendance per GP, has fallen. One explanation may be the retirement of older, more experienced GPs, who are replaced by new recruits, he said.\"This [fall in productivity] is likely due to younger, less experienced GPs spending more time on average either with patients and/or undertaking clinical administrative tasks relative to their more experienced peers,\" he said.Mr Hadassin said Primary may begin to struggle to attract GPs who are happy to work up to 50 hours a week. \"Our analysis shows that a significant proportion of GPs are no longer working full time, partly due to the increase in females as a percentage of GP graduates,\" he said.More doctorsTo make up for the shortfall, Primary may have to pay more to acquire enough doctors, he said. \"Primary's absolute GP acquisition costs may need to increase relative to historic levels to cover a greater number of GPs required to replace those full time departures.\"Primary's GP numbers have risen about 7 per cent on a compound annual basis from 604 in 2007-08 to about 920 in 2013-14, Mr Hadassin said.Primary's medical centres had earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $175.8 million in the year ended June 30, 2014, which was up 4.4 per cent. The division contributed 44 per cent of Primary's overall EBITDA, alongside the pathology (39 per cent) and diagnostic imaging businesses (18 per cent).The medical centre division is run by Henry Bateman, one of three internal candidates in line to take the managing director role after the retirement of his father, and the company's founder, Edmund Bateman . The other candidates are Dr Bateman's other son James Bateman and finance director Andrew Duff. Dr Bateman has been on sick leave since September and will formally step down in January.Primary shares fell 0.6 per cent on Tuesday to $4.64, down from a 12-month high of $5.04 hit in March.

The First Girlfriend (or \"First Mistress'' as she is sometimes cruelly dubbed) is a public figure with her own office at the Elys\u00c3\u00a9e Palace and a sizeable staff and access to perks including limousine travel.Yet her status has always been ambiguous. Trierweiler is both a journalist at Paris Match and a First Lady who, being unmarried, has no legal claim to her position. She took up with Hollande while he was still living with his former partner Royal, and was apparently the last person to know about the extent of her boyfriend's latest affair.CynicalThe cynical attempt by Hollande to mask his latest gaffe with the stale French excuse of protecting his private life, have been shattered by this woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Tuesday's highly anticipated press conference where Hollande is supposed to relaunch his political strategy for 2014 and announce reductions in public spending and tax breaks, has been completely overwhelmed by the latest theatrics in his private life.This small-minded man, who has done nothing to turn around France's economic decline, is not only unfit to govern, he appears to run his personal life as poorly and chaotically as he does the country.If the French continue to shrug their shoulders at such shenanigans it shows how cynical they have become under their historically unpopular president. Enough of the laments for the ''good old days'' when Francois Mitterrand could have a double life, two families and an illegitimate daughter, that all the press knew about but no one wrote about.A bit of transparency is in order even if that means the cherished French attachment to privacy is compromised.", "AFR_1060": "The recently retired director of the United States National Security Agency says Australia was correct to exclude Chinese telecommunications manufacturer Huawei from helping build the national broadband network because of evidence of Chinese espionage against the nation.Keith Alexander, arguably the world's most important cyber spy at the time of the previous Labor government's ban on Huawei, described it as a \"tremendous\" decision and suggested UK officials who permitted Huawei to work on similar projects may now regret that decision.It is the second time a high-ranking US security figure has weighed in on the debate, which was criticised by many as excessive and needlessly damaging to Australian trade relations with China.Last July former director of the US Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency Michael Hayden told The Australian Financial Review Huawei was a significant security threat to Australia and the US, and that intelligence agencies had evidence it has spied for the Chinese government. \"I think what Australia did on the Huawei decision was tremendous. I believe the decision-making process, specifically when they went out and got the best advice from everybody to come up with their decision, was outstanding,\" General Alexander said.\"I think they made the right decision and I applaud them for that. There have been numerous examples that your country has seen where China has exploited various parts of your nation's government and commercial activities. Giving them access to your nation's network does not make sense.\"The decision upset Beijing and was opposed by some senior government members. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop backed revisiting the move.Last month the Financial Review revealed Chinese intelligence agencies that penetrated Australia's parliamentary computer network in 2011 may have been inside the system for up to a year reading emails and accessing confidential files.General Alexander said if the UK government spoke to Australian intelligence agencies and reviewed the processes Australia went through to reach the Huawei decision, it might change its approach if it had its time again.Huawei is not the only Chinese technology vendor to have had its commercial activities in Australia restricted due to security concerns. Last July the AFR revealed computers made by the world's biggest personal computer maker, Lenovo, were banned from the secret and top secret networks of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence alliance of Australia, the US, Britain, Canada and New Zealand because of concerns they could be hijacked.Claims of hypocrisyCritics have pointed to hypocrisy in banning Chinese tech suppliers when revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have highlighted the role some US-based companies play in aiding US surveillance. General Alexander said the comparison was not valid.\"The close ties between the Chinese government and industry are in no way comparable to the relations between the US government and US industry,\" he said.He said media controversy over disclosures of surveillance under the PRISM program could jeopardise US industry sales and threatened the reputation of some of the US's most important companies. The NSA had failed some of these organisations by not setting the record straight about misconceptions of their role in spying. \"NSA should have done more to set the record straight sooner on companies' commitment to protecting privacy, the lengths to which companies go to do this, the legally compelled nature of these programs, and that these companies comply with the law,\" he said.\"We must explain to the public that our foreign intelligence collection programs do not involve the tech companies indiscriminately providing wholesale information to the government, and those companies and our government are heavily constrained by the courts, Congress and the executive branch.\"He said the FAA 702 program, which compels US tech companies to provide information to the intelligence community, was similar and often less extensive than programs in other Western countries. Greens Senator Scott Ludlum, a vocal critic of the NSA, said General Alexander's defence of its practices was difficult to believe. \"I think all that Mr Alexander is engaging in here is an act of damage control, but the fact is there is a lot of damage. We have had people as senior as [US director of national intelligence] James Clapper outright lying to congressional committees about the activities of the NSA. The NSA's activities have been found to be unlawful and it was acting well outside of its mandate.\"", "AFR_1041": "A natural inscrutability has generally served Solomon Lew pretty nicely, thank you very much.But rarely has his preference for the shadows of privacy achieved as much as the prize now within reach, with the decision by South African retailer Woolworths to conclude 17 years of living uncomfortably with Lew as its junior partner in the once-troubled, now recovered, clothes outlet, Country Road.It is wisdom general and received that Lew has been hounding Woolworths for more than a decade for a price big enough to encourage his profitable exit from Country Road.Now Woolworths has obliged, lobbing an offer of $17 a share at Country Road's 182 minority shareholders. The clean-up will cost Woolworths $213 million.It is reckoned Lew paid no more than $25 million for the 11.88 per cent of Country Road he collected in 1997 with the overt intention of complicating the South African's takeover.His cussedness left Woolworths tantalisingly close to the compulsory acquisition threshold of 90 per cent. And there things have stayed, at least until Tuesday morning.Now, if he accepts the Woolies offer, Lew will bank $207 million, along with the thanks of the other 181 minority owners, 54 of whom have currently unmarketable parcels of Country Road scrip.To bother asking why the South Africans might suddenly feel so generous towards Lew, you must have first ignored the brewing threat that history was in the process of repeating itself.Woolworths is getting to the pointy end of a $2.2 billion scheme offer for David Jones. To make that work requires the support of 75 per cent of the register and more than 50 per cent of shareholders at an EGM.That meeting was to be held on June 30 but Lew's last-minute intervention over the past three weeks has seen denouement delayed until Bastille Day.Under the cloak of invisibility woven by local market regulation that has failed to force the transparency of declaration on derivatives markets, Lew assembled a 9.89 per cent interest in David Jones.Lew was revealed as a 0.65 per cent owner of David Jones on 30 May. Ten days earlier, Deutsche Bank emerged as a substantial shareholder in the retailer with a 5.4 per cent interest that quickly became 6.69 per cent.On Saturday The Australian Financial Review reported DB was not acting for Lew. There is a view that DB has borrowed stock worth about 5 per cent of David Jones. It is reckoned Lew directly owns maybe 7 per cent of the company and has borrowed votes that delivered him to this now declared position. And it is reckoned DB delivered Lew a considerable portion of the stock he actually owns and then covered its short position by borrowing further stock.Whatever the mechanics, 18 days after being confirmed as an owner, Lew had borrowed or bought another 9.24 per cent of David Jones without pausing for disclosure.From the moment of confirmation Lew's widely appreciated ability to keep himself to himself began to pay dividends in the form of speculation over his intent.As analysis of past votes at David Jones shareholder meetings indicated Lew would need barely 13 per cent to block Woolies, rumours emerged the retailers senior owners had been invited to lend their stock to a date after decision day.And, in the meantime, there was some considered commentary by the The Sydney Morning Herald's voice of esteem, Liz Knight, suggesting Lew's ultimate target was an acceptable exit price for his Country Road position.That this theory has been put to market test says Knight's view could be very well informed indeed.To that end, Woolworths people say there is no arrangement between it and Lew on an exit strategy. Yes, there have been discussions between the South African's bankers and Lew's people. But there is no arrangement.That proposition is reinforced, possibly, by a condition attached to the Country Road offer that says the offer will only proceed if David Jones shareholders support the Woolworths transaction.There is, of course, some delicacy in this situation. There has been talk that an arrangement that sees Lew exit Country Road after supporting the David Jones deal might warrant regulatory assessment under the collateral benefit rules.The law requires shareholders be treated equally in takeovers. But not only do schemes sit outside of the collateral benefit framework but, the fact is, the shareholders relevant to the Country Road transaction are indeed being treated with equanimity.What happens at David Jones is a legal matter quite distinct from what happens at Country Road.Nonetheless, it does all feel rather cute for comfort, doesn't it?Lew has walked through a gap in the disclosure rules to build a position on the David Jones register and to threaten further uncertainty on Woolworths' ambitions only to have the South African offer him the chance to make a $179 million on a legacy situation.There are two discrete streams to BHP Billiton's push to lower costs and improve productivity across all the asset classes in its global footprint.The first sits active within each of the product silos and that is pretty much where all of the pruning now becoming apparent on both wings of BHP's Australia starts and finishes.And then there is the more tectonic, structural work being done within the confines of BHP's brand-spanking new Melbourne headquarters. That has apparently involved a small procession of external consultants, including the global Australian's long-time favourite set of fresh eyes, McKinsey &amp; Co.It is understood McKinsey's contribution to Andrew Mackenzie's group-wide productivity initiative currently sits in an inbox awaiting further group general management committee assessment. From what we understand, this work is focused on group-wide options. It was reported in The West Australian on Tuesday this appraisal has arrived with the potential of 3000 job losses through BHP's Western Australian iron ore business. The report in the West also found WA's number-two iron ore producer had already squeezed up to 500 jobs out of its business and more cuts were brewing.Now the observable count of job losses this year sits at 270, but BHP Iron Ore has taken no real exception to the idea the real number is closer to 500.That cohort of the recently departed includes a whole lot of people who were engaged in expansion projects that have been delivered or are pretty close to completion.It also includes 170 from the mine that started BHP's Pilbara story, the legendary Mount Whaleback. It has years of production left in it, but after 48 years of production, its decline in relevance is inevitable and in full swing.So what of the idea that BHP Iron Ore, the company's biggest and most efficient profit generator through the boom years, could surrender up to 20 per cent of its iron ore workforce by the time this two-pronged assault on productivity rolls to maturity?Well, BHP does not specifically deny this potential has been revealed by the assessments now sitting with its GMC. To the contrary, the official position is this \"focus on productivity is not new\". Whatever the outcome here, it should be recognised as the natural product of the era that is ending in the Pilbara.The great leap forward in capacity is near fulfilment. And as expansion phases in bulk commodities come to a close, two things happen:Markets move into short-term supply-side surplus and medium-term equilibrium with prices moderating to long-run bands. As a result, operators begin to focus on cost reduction and delivering at least the same with less.To make that happen requires the sort of intimate review being run at BHP's iron and coal businesses and then, potentially, the sort of broad structural review that appears to be under contemplation. And, in the end, this should come as no surprise to anyone. Because it is exactly what Andrew Mackenzie promised to deliver when he was appointed in February last year.", "AFR_1011": "When you're travelling in style it's the going that's important, not the getting there, writes Craig Tansley.Should you wish to be reminded that the journey is as important as the destination, then climb on a long-distance train.\"If a train is large and comfortable you don't even need a destination,\" says travel writer Paul Theroux.Luxury long-distance train journeys allow passengers to travel back in time to a bygone era, but the best train journeys today don't forget it's 2014.

The founders believe it may even help discover the trading superstars of tomorrow.It's more of an evolution than revolution - bringing together aspects of established websites such as Covestor and SelfWealth, which verify investment performance - with a robust trading engine that has attracted more than 100,000 clients around the globe to Saxo Bank Group's portal known as TradingFloor.com.Saxo Bank co-founder and co-chief executive Kim Fournais said he anticipated a lot of interest from Australian traders who were more engaged with financial markets than counterparts from other regions.The platform is available in beta testing mode now to traders around the world, including Australian clients of Saxo Capital Markets. \"I think you are way ahead of the curve in Australia,\" he told Smart Investor from Saxo's headquarters in Hellerup, Copenhagen.\"You are geographically isolated, so there is a keen interest in foreign exchange and you are a commodity country, so you understand multi-asset markets,\" he said.Accounts mirror real time\"A much bigger proportion of Australians have positions in the market than in Denmark, for instance, where they leave those decisions up to someone else.\"However, the platform's most powerful and potentially most controversial feature is yet to go live.Known as \"autotrading\", this feature would see registered users subscribe to a profiled trader and have their accounts mirror their positions as they unfold in real time.\"Auto trading will digitalise the investment management world. The whole idea is really to commercialise this and digitalise the fund of funds industry\" Mr Fournais said.In the 20 years since Mr Fournais started the online-only bank with co-founder and co-chief executive Lars Seier Christensen, Saxo has built a reputation as a challenger brand, as it steadily chipped away market share from Europe's banks and brokerages.Now he has funds management and sell-side research in his firing line.Saxo has set a stretch target of up to one million traders joining and sharing trades in an online investment community that aims to harness the benefits of \"crowdsourcing\" for the ordinary investor.New transparency\"This new transparency will completely change the advisory model, from having some guy in a bank telling you to buy this and sell that; that Vodafone is going up or down. What this platform does is let you interact with people who know a hell of a lot more about Vodafone than we do,\" Mr Fournais said.However, with those aspirations come considerable risks and Saxo has promised to keep a close eye on how the autotrading feature is deployed, aware that the lure of big returns at the click of a button may be too much for some.\"It's safe to say that someone who made 800 per cent in a year trades with a relative high degree of risk; however, there may be other people who have a capital allocation model that consists of ETFs,\" he said.To that end, users are able to access considerable amounts of data about an individual trader's performance, including various measures of risk, which may help them find traders and styles of investment in line with their own tolerance for volatility. \"There's lots of risk, there's no doubt. The world is full of risk,\" Mr Fournais said. \"But we want to build something we can tell our mothers and brothers to use. I would not tell my mother to use highly leveraged foreign exchange,\" he said.Autotrading isn't an entirely new concept. Foreign-exchange trading outfit FX Copy, among others, has been offering this as a service since late 2012.Ability to embed trade ticketsHowever, Saxo claims this will be the first truly multi-asset platform to offer autotrading across literally tens of thousands of instruments.Saxo chief digital and communications officer Rune Bech said another key point of difference was the ability to embed trade tickets into alerts and trading ideas published by community members. \"It's as easy as finding a hotel room online,\" he said. \"It's a one-click experience.\"As seamless as the experience is, the product - and indeed the concept - is by no means perfect. In negotiating the line between personal privacy and community transparency, they have at this point decided not to disclose the cash holdings of individual investors.The cash holdings of an investor can have a huge impact on how a particular trade fits into their overall strategy, especially at a time when many believe markets are looking toppy.Furthermore, there does not seem to be any indication of how much leverage is being employed.As the product is primarily targeted at traders of derivatives and foreign exchange, this omission presents a considerable obstacle to the overall goal of complete transparency.For Saxo there is a lot riding on the new platform.The initiative marks what is shaping up to be an aggressive period of growth for the sometimes controversial founders.Free market enthusiasmIn their home country of Denmark, they are well-known for their enthusiasm for free markets, which extends to offering all visitors to their impressive Denmark headquarters a free copy of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.Mr Fournais recently confirmed that Saxo would be looking to take the privately owned online trading specialist public some time in the next two years.It follows the return of both Mr Fournais and Mr Christensen to operational roles in the business at the beginning of 2013 following a period of extreme upheaval during the EU debt crisis that saw 17.5 per cent of the workforce retrenched.\"We are definitely looking for more operational leverage, to put more through the machine, so to speak. But that needs to be a win-win situation. We can't expect to attract new clients just because we want to grow,\" Mr Fournais said.It will be equally important to its local operations, Saxo Capital Markets, which is operating in a highly competitive space.The business has had several false starts in Australia and is now approaching the end of a two-year period of special conditions and reviews of its processes following the collapse of broker Sonray, which offered a white-labelled version of its trading platform.After almost 18 months in development in Copenhagen, the litmus test will be how traders themselves take to the new technology. Investors can try out the service for themselves at beta.tradingfloor.com.

But large companies are banned from using the technology.Despite the ban, which is being reviewed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), major US companies are racing to develop the capability of drones to improve customer service, save money and get a bird's eye view of hard to see places.Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of e-retailer Amazon, has talked up the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver small packages to customers in less than 30 minutes.Amazon is now pitted in a head-to-head battle with Google to become the first US company to deliver goods via drone on a large scale.Oil and gas major ExxonMobil wants to conduct pipeline and flare stack inspections from drones.In Britain, a Domino's franchise last year delivered two pizzas in a heatwave bag via the \"DomiCopter\".Despite the attractions, there are some major legal hurdles drone-advocates in the US need to overcome.Only two commercial licences have been granted by the FAA. Oil giant BP in June was licensed to use a six-kilogram aircraft to collect and analyse data at its oil field in Alaska.Other businesses in the US are ignoring the commercial ban and using drones anyway.The prohibition exists for two major reasons; concerns about safety and privacy.The US has more air traffic than any other country in the world. Without proper rules in place, regulators worry that an influx of drones into the national airspace could result in midair crashes or accidents on the ground if drones fall from the sky.Civil libertarians fret about law enforcement agencies and others using drones to snoop on people in backyards or conduct other surveillance.'You have to hold people accountable'Among the professions touted to be able to exploit the technology is the Paparazzi, replacing their long zoom cameras with remote controlled aircraft mounted with a GoPro camera to snap celebrities in secluded locations.Michael Toscana, president of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, admits unmanned aircraft are an \"extension of your eyes and ears\".But he says the answer is not to prevent the new disruptive technology. The internet has enabled cyber theft, transmission of pornography and online bullying, but it is not banned.Similarly, he says, more than a million people die in car accidents around the world each year, but there is no suggestion cars should be banned.\"You have to hold people accountable for misuse of the technology,\" Toscana says. \"If it can never have an incident or failure, then you will never field the technology.\"The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International is advocating for every commercial drone to carry an electronic chip registered on a FAA database to identify the operator.Drone proponents are also trumpeting the significant cost savings to business drones offer.Depending on the size of the drone, the cost can range from about $100 to $200 an hour, compared to up to $2000 an hour for a manned aircraft.The option to lease, rather than buy the aircraft, also saves large capital investment outlays and provides flexibility in choosing the type of drone for different tasks, Declet says.The FAA is due to publish long-awaited US guidelines for commercial drones weighing less than 25 kilograms this year. It's likely to be several years before drones are allowed to operate commercially in the US.Another dilemma that will need to be solved is that the current aviation law requires aircraft to be controlled by a licensed pilot. Toscano believes that law needs to reflect modern reality.\"The joke is in the future there is going to be a dog and pilot in the cockpit,\" Toscano says.\"The pilot is there to feed the dog and the dog is there to bite the pilot if he tries to touch any of the buttons.\"", "AFR_1025": "The Australia Day honours brought few top accolades to senior federal public servants.

Military division AOs went to the deputy chief of the navy, Rear-Admiral Trevor Jones, and Air Vice-Marshal Gavin Davies.Another former secretary, Conall O'Connell (Agriculture), was awarded an AM, as were seven other current or former federal public servants: Ross Tellam (CSIRO); Ross Sundberg and Peter Gray (former Federal Court judges); Moira Scollay (former privacy commissioner); David Savage (Foreign Affairs); Shelley Peers (Academy of Science); and Eric North (Australian National Gallery). OAMs went to Andrew Beadle (AirServices Australia, for services to civil air traffic management); John Ingram (Defence, for services to the refugee community) and the ABC's Drew Morphett (for services to sport as a broadcaster, commentator and presenter).Among 14 public service medals given to serving or former Commonwealth officials was one posthumous award. It went to Finance's former head of the ministerial and parliamentary services division, Kim Clarke, for her outstanding service, particularly in relation to accountability and transparency of parliamentary entitlements. Ms Clarke was an exemplary public servant who would often be seen at Senate estimates patiently answering questions about pollies' entitlements. Anyone who followed the Peter Slipper affair would know just how demanding her job was. Ms Clarke lost a long battle with breast cancer on September 12, 2013.With Australia Day and school holidays over, there are now only 12 more sleeps until Parliament resumes with a quick three-day sitting of the House of Representatives. Then there is a week off, followed by a fortnight of sittings including a week of Senate additional estimates hearings. Non-government senators and the federal opposition are likely to hone in on the still-pending commission of audit preliminary report, public service job cuts, the 40 or so Rudd-esque reviews and to government secrecy.", "AFR_1073": "Australia will move to a new credit reporting model next week, which will take ito account both positive and adverse information on borrower's credit files.Eight years in the planning, the new system should enable lenders to get a more comprehensive idea of an applicant's borrowing history, allowing some borrowers to access cheaper home loans and others to obtain loan approval where previously they would have been denied.Changes to the Privacy Act, which take effect from March 12, will allow lenders to share \"positive\" borrowing information, such as the number of successful credit applications, recent repayment histories and credit limits. Currently, only adverse credit events are kept on a personal credit file and can remain there for up to five years.Angus Luffman from credit reporting agency Veda said lenders generally supported the changes but it would take time to transition to the new system. \"It won't happen on day one,\" he said. \"It will also be up to lenders to contribute data and get the benefits.\"Smartline mortgage broker Michael Daniels said it made sense for lenders to be able to provide money at cheaper rates to those who manage it well.", "AFR_1040": "Paul Kallenbach predicts the use of wearable technology such as Google Glass will be widespread and mainstream within only five years.As a partner specialising in intellectual property and technology law at law firm Minter Ellison, Kallenbach's big challenge is to find a way for professional services firms to use something like Google Glass at work and while interacting with clients.\"In five years, we will have something like that but probably not that bulky,\" he says, pointing at a Google Glass while talking to The Australian Financial Review.\"You could use the video for client interviews. If you're in a meeting or a negotiation, doing a board presentation or giving a talk, then you could get quick chunks of information and use them quickly. But it will rely on people accepting you can wear these without being put off by them. I don't think we're quite there yet and we have a bit of a way to go.\"When the technology becomes more widespread, Kallenbach says companies will then need to consider the implications of its use.\"The obvious one that jumps to mind is privacy,\" he says. \"There's implications for people around you being videotaped, for example. Do workplaces need a policy for this? It seems so. A lot of this information will also run through the servers of large corporates, so what are the Googles and Facebooks and others of the world going to do with the information that is collected?\"Whatever happens, Kallenbach wants to ensure his firm is at the cutting edge when the technology becomes more user-friendly.Wearable technology is part of what he terms the \"contextual computing arc\", the third such era in his lifetime and another he hopes combines his keen interest in technology with his work.Kallenbach's interest in technology was first raised when his parents bought a Sinclair ZX80 home computer when he was 10.An Apple II came later, which involved \"playing the Lode Runner game and programming in basic. That first arc for me was that passion for me for technology, and I always wanted to combine that with my work,\" he recalls.Speeding aheadBy the mid-1990s, Kallenbach had a law degree and had begun work at his current firm. It was the beginning of the internet era, which changed the way professional services could be delivered, and the speed at which clients expected things to happen.The way legal research could be conducted and the way firms communicated with clients, changed forever in a rapid period.Kallenbach sensed an opportunity and left the firm in 2000 to join with two other entrepreneurs to establish their own technology firm, Speed Legal. \"Our idea was to revolutionise the legal world with document automation,\" he says.\"I was involved for about three years. It was a great learning experience. Being at the coalface and seeing what it's like developing something from scratch, prototyping it and selling it.\"Speed Legal is still operating today, having changed its named to Exari, but Kallenbach departed the venture to rejoin Minter Ellison.In 2008, he was made partner and put in charge of the firm's technology and online responsibilities. That has included helping to formulate the BoardTRAC app for clients, which delivers board notes and papers to board members via a secure iPad environment.\"We try to tailor it with Minter content, as well. There's transaction guides and how-to-do guides for directors, which are written by Minter's lawyers. It's a board portal and advisory portal,\" he says.Kallenbach has also helped shape the firm's social media strategy, including establishing technology-specific Twitter accounts and an online blog.\"We've got a lot of enthusiastic young lawyers already writing things for their clients, so it isn't a big jump from doing that to also blogging with their own style on particular subjects,\" he says.Kallenbach says the next phase in the firm's move towards quasi-publisher will be to pump out more video content, which he says has proven popular with clients, fellow lawyers and law students.\"We've had quite a lot of feedback saying that 10-minute video, either one-on-one chats or pieces-to-camera can be quite popular, especially via social media,\" he says.", "AFR_1079": "The former state treasurer's ambitions were scuttled in a matter of minutes, writes Jonathan Barrett.In the very early hours of Sunday, February 23, Western Australian treasurer and transport minister Troy Buswell made a decision that would destroy his political ambitions. Instead of taking one of the many chauffeurs provided for guests at the wedding reception he attended on Saturday night, Buswell drove his ministerial car home.It was just a couple of kilometres and a handful of turns to his apartment. At last count, he is suspected of hitting three parked cars, a telegraph post and his front fence, while under the influence of the night's celebrations.Within 36 hours, the Liberal treasurer suffered a breakdown, was hospitalised and had resigned from cabinet. The career of a former premier-aspirant who, at one time, could have easily and successfully switched ito federal politics, was as banged up as his white Holden Caprice.Every so often, an otherwise successful and promising political career is abruptly halted. In 1997, former Labor senator Nick Sherry attempted suicide after allegations of travel rorts. In 2005, John Brogden attempted suicide a day after resigning the NSW Liberal leadership in disgrace.Are public breakdowns caused by a scandal or are the scandals symptomatic of an impending breakdown?Questions over Barnett's judgment The answer to that is key for the future of Troy Raymond Buswell. The answer also reflects on the judgment of WA Premier Colin Barnett, who reinstated the problem-plagued Buswell in 2012 to the second-most important job in government.The Liberals are calling for understanding and privacy, in an implicit attempt to tie the suspected drink-driving and mental health breakdown together.That position implies Buswell has diminished responsibility.Labor has called for an inquiry ito the car incident, in an attempt to separate the issues, and hold the now former treasurer and transport minister - but still Liberal member - to account. Which implies full responsibility.One Labor frontbencher told AFR Weekend that Buswell needed to be held accountable so that if he ever returned to the frontbench he would be a former transport minister who caused havoc after drink-driving.Even if the alleged drink-driving was part of the breakdown, rather than its trigger, Buswell is not necessarily going to be one day welcomed back to a prominent political position.Debate over responsibilityDave Keatley, lecturer in psychology at Curtin University in Perth, says there is debate in academic circles as to how responsible someone is for their actions during a breakdown. But he believes that ultimately, individuals are responsible, even if their thinking ability is diminished.\"I think there's a real risk if we were to say they are not responsible,\" says Keatley.He says that does not mean the public should not show understanding during the person's recovery.\"Humanity in a way should come first, regardless of whether the crash caused the breakdown or the crash was symptomatic of the breakdown.\"Breakdowns occur when levels of stress, that otherwise help motivate someone, hit a catastrophic point that results in an extreme shift in personality.In the lead-up to a breakdown, close friends and colleagues often detect the signs, because the person's work suffers.If they hold a public office, this will probably lead to negative feedback, which only pushes the person closer to their breaking point.Too much work?But as Barnett noted early in the week, the more work Buswell was given, the more he seemed to thrive.Buswell was handling two of the most important and difficult portfolios: in Treasury and transport.WA had recently lost its triple-A credit rating, and the government was under sustained attack for failing to fulfil pre-election transport infrastructure commitments.He was the Liberal's go-to man, despite experiencing a turbulent career noted by inappropriate and at times sexist behaviour.There are mixed views on whether Buswell showed any signs of unhealthy stress leading up to the February incident, although at least three people who spent time with him at the wedding reception told AFR Weekend that the decision to drive home was hard to comprehend.\"He was very well behaved until 11:30pm,\" says one of the wedding reception guests.\"I've never ever seen him drive home after having a few drinks. Something must have gone wrong with his brain.\"", "AFR_1018": "A group of Australians has just embarked on a voyage of discovery ito the new world of genomic medicine.Each paid $5000 for a berth and will attend a two-day event at Sydney's Garvan Institute next week, where they will explore their own genome.The group of 50 is a mix of thought leaders from the community and researchers who work or have an interest in genomics.The intent of this voyage is to introduce them to issues associated with having access to personal genetic information and to the potential it offers.This \"advance party\" will experience what the rest of us are expected to begin experiencing over the next decade and beyond.Rather than ask these business leaders, politicians and experts in governance, medicine, research, ethics and policy to attend a routine conference, the innovative aspect of this event is to give each of them a direct interest in the subject by decoding their own genome.Relatively uncharted territoryWhile there is plenty of proof of principle in the usefulness of genomics in health, much of the territory is yet to be charted and developed.John Mattick, professor and executive director of the Garvan, says we are where Qantas was a century ago with its fragile bi-planes: everyone knew flying was possible but no aviation industry existed yet.Genomic medicine is only going in one direction, he says. In five to 20 years, it will become increasingly routine, and at birth or even before birth, babies will have their genomes sequenced.This information will be part of an individual's medical record and allow their doctors to optimise their health in the future.Mattick says there is a genetic component in our susceptibility to most diseases and if we can identify these susceptibilities, the hope is that we can find a way to intervene or monitor, to prevent the worst aspects manifesting.Some of this is already possible. About 1 per cent of Australian babies are born with genetic disease called haemochromatosis, a silent form of iron overload.It causes incipient lethargy and in most cases goes undetected. Some people get liver failure later in life.All of this is avoided by early detection and treatment, and affected children can go on to an active and healthy life.Some 5 per cent of the population has genetic mutations that affect blood clotting. They are at significant risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and probably stroke.If detected, these consequences are easily preventable.Valuable informationThere are many more examples, and the combined value of whole genome sequence information is enormous, both for individual health and the health system.By increasing our personal genetic information, Mattick says we can move from the art of crisis management to the science of good health.Cancer is a priority, and already genomics is changing the way cancer is defined. In some cases it is changing the way it is treated.\"We now realise cancer is a multi-headed beast caused by a range of mutations in different genes.\"He says once the \"driver mutation\" is known, drugs developed to treat that mutation in one type of tissue can often be usefully applied in another.The upcoming event, called Understand Your Genome (UYG) has already been held five times in the United States and once in the United Kingdom.To protect the privacy of their genetic information, the identity of the Sydney participants has remained confidential.Each had to meet rigid requirements, which included having genetic counselling and providing informed consent before supplying blood samples.These were shipped to Illumina, the biotech company in San Diego that is organising this event in partnership with the Garvan.Over the past few weeks, participants have been asked to visit their genetic specialists to receive their headline results from the sequencing of their genome.At the UYG event, they will each receive an iPad with the full details and have a genetic expert privately interpret their findings.They will also discuss critical issues necessary to prepare the community for the era of genomic, or so-called personalised medicine.Of key importance is developing policies and infrastructure necessary to apply genomics in patient care, as well as the education of the medical and general community.The infrastructure includes the development of vast genome knowledge databases that are already under way. These will need to be linked to e-health record networks.Mattick believes genomics will transform the course of medical science, community health and the national economy.He attended a UYG in San Diego last year and discovered, among other things, that he was a carrier for cystic fibrosis. This was news to him as he had no immediate family history of it.Marcel Dinger, head of the Garvan's Centre for Clinical Genomics, also attended that meeting and learned he had an allergy to the most commonly-used anaesthetic.He has never been anaesthetised, which is fortunate. Had he had this drug, it would have led to muscle seizures, a temperature spike and possibly death.READ NEXT: Sequence of major drops in cost for DNA", "AFR_1048": "Australia and the United States are to share more information on bank accounts under a tax agreement signed by Treasurer Joe Hockey on Monday.The deal gives Australia more time to fall into line with the US government's Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA),which requires the reporting of accounts held by Americans, and spares Australian banks some of the red tape associated with the new law.Under the intergovernmental agreement (IGA), the US and Australia will every year automatically swap detailed information on bank accounts held by each other's citizens.Australia has been given until September next year to pass legislation implementing the deal, and will be deemed to be complying with FATCA in the meantime.FATCA was otherwise due to take effect on July 1 this year.Australian banks will still have to register with the US tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service.However, they will be exempt from requirements under FATCA to give the IRS details of accounts held by Americans. Instead, they will report the information to the Australian Taxation Office.The deal means Australian banks will also not be required to withhold 30 per cent of payments related to accounts held by Americans that don't meet FATCA's disclosure requirements.''If the Australian banks had to report to the US IRS that would just be a nightmare,'' said Paul Spacey, tax and security manager at the Australian Bankers Association.''There were domestic law privacy impediments which would make it hard for Australian banks to register directly with the IRS without the IGA.''There has already been a huge cost for Australian banks to comply with FATCA but it would be much greater without the IGA.''Mr Hockey said the government would introduce legislation bedding down the deal ''as soon as practicable''.In a joint memorandum of understanding, Australia and the US said Australia may get a one-year extension to the deadline to pass legislation if the US Treasury ''receives credible assurances that such a delay is likely to be resolved in a reasonable period of time\".Bank account information to be swapped between the two countries includes names, addresses, account numbers and balances.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in February that FATCA had been a catalyst for the G20's push towards greater information sharing.The rules have informed the group's new global standard on automatic exchange.", "AFR_1084": "As a now-defunct terrorist organisation once pointed out: \"We only have to be lucky once. You have to be lucky all the time\". So far the professionalism, dedication and capacity of our intelligence and police forces have headed off terror attacks in this country before any have happened - now on a third occasion after plots were foiled in 2005 and 2009. Each time a plot is thwarted, it is the result of hard work, patience and, no doubt, some luck too. But terror groups evolve their tactics all the time.The Federal Police had been listening to chatter between Omarjan Azari and his senior contact in Islamic State for four months before they decided it was time to move very quickly. The plot had suddenly shifted from targeting a politician or other high-profile person to kidnapping an ordinary passerby for the gruesome ritual of recorded propaganda killing.Two years ago, an attack like this would have seemed too far-fetched to believe. But the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street in 2013 dramatically raised the dangers. It was the kind of combination that the security forces fear most, with elements of the random, lone-wolf attack that is hard to detect and track, but supported by a vast global network of jihadi websites inspiring and training real and would-be terrorists across the globe. The internet is a great highway of ideas and communication. But some have made it an open sewer as well, ideally suited for elusive plotting and vile propaganda.The pull of terrorist groups in the Middle East among a tiny number of people across the world has brought terror directly into Australia. The reasons are complex, but there have always been impressionable or marginalised young men who have been drawn to attractive extremist messages. The black flags of IS have plenty of precedents in totalitarian movements around the world. They all feed on the power of the group, where the individual conscience is submerged into collective approval, and where grotesque acts like those plotted in Sydney until a few days ago are all too possible.Australia is right to join the effort in Iraq to stamp out the source of IS terror and to deny it a safe haven from which outgrowths like those in Australia come. There have long been things considered an affront to all nations which they will declare outlawed or work together to stamp out. Once it was things like piracy and slavery. Now it is the terror of IS, reflected in the coalition of nations, including Iraq's neighbours, which have united to fight it. The biggest proportion of Western IS recruits per capita come from impeccably multi-cultural countries like Belgium and Denmark with no history of intervening in the Middle East. Failing to play our part in subduing IS in Iraq would not have made us any safer here.That does not avert the risk of inflaming fears in the Muslim community that our engagement in Iraq either victimises them, or implicates them, even by association. It is essential that the government and security services defuse this issue.Terror groups will always claim to speak for minority communities and to be their protector. Denying terrorists any opportunity to do so by not denigrating Muslims or painting them all with the acts of a few rogues could not be more important. Likewise, terrorists conceal themselves in communities, and tracking them down cannot happen without their co-operation. The fact that much of the information that comes to the security services is from the Muslim community itself suggests that few have conflicted loyalties. Preserving that trust is now vital.There are issues for the wide community, too. Guarding an open society like Australia involves a tricky balance between security, human rights and privacy. We are confident that the machinery is in place to maintain that balance.", "AFR_1086": "Society Howard Goldenberg flew into one of Australia's most isolated and fragiletowns to see what he could do for the young women there. What he found tells us a lot about the outback future of a vulnerable people.I fly to Wadeye with wary curiosity. People say the generation of elders there - in the Northern Territory, south-west of Darwin, and on the fringe of the Daly River Reserve - has lost all authority, that adults live in fear of the kids; I want to see for myself and I want to learn about the Women's Uprising.The \"uprising\" is my own term for the quiet subversion of modern obstetric arrangements by outback women.Time and again (in my capacity as a district medical officer for remote Central Australia) I have dispatched Flying Doctors to remote locations to retrieve women in obstetric emergency.They are all supposed to deliver in larger centres, regional hospitals, where mothers and babies are safer. But time and again, the woman who was flown out to the hospital last Monday is back home on Thursday; and there, in deepest Woop Woop, she comes into labour, at great risk to herself and her baby. She has returned from a foreign place to give birth in her own place. By the time I receive the call, she or her baby is in danger.The insurrection against obstetric policy is a phenomenon of the humble and the disempowered: teenage girls and mature women alike sneak back home to give birth.And it is in Wadeye that the phenomenon has occurred frequently enough to be described and published in academic papers.Many whitefellas have read of Wadeye but not as many recognise the name whenthey hear it. It looks like wad-eye, but it's pronounced wad-air. Its colonial name is Port Keats. Port Keats was founded in 1934 by Father Richard Docherty. His parting gift was flour and tobacco.Much of the fate of Wadeye is the unintended legacy of the whitefella gifts of Catholicism, refined starches and tobacco. Seventy-five years after the arrival of Father Docherty, diabetes and heart disease occupya huge clinic and a large tribe of nurses and doctors.I am one of the latter.The church built a school and taught an early generation to read, write and enter the 20th century.The school continues to function under church auspices and within its large campusresides Wadeye's hope for the future. Gang warfareWhitefellas who have heard of Wadeye have also read of the gang warfare on its streets at night. Youngsters in their teens gather with their weapons - generally sticks, palings, pickets - and posture at their enemies. Sometimes these real weapons are wielded to effect real bodily harm.On the aircraft, I find myself seated next to a psychiatry registrar based in the territory. I point out the headline on the front page of today's newspaper. It reads: \"Mozzie kills tourist\". My companion says: \"The press reporting about the territory is not nuanced. For example, the press declares that Alice Springs has the highest stabbing rate in the world. Do you know Hermannsburg?\"I do.\"The stabbing rate there is four times higher than in Alice. They have only 485 people living there, but they need a clinic with a full-time doctor and a staff of 27.\"Down south, the broadsheets read like tabloids: \"Mayhem in Wadeye!\" The papers explain that the different gangs are playing out ancient clan grievances in a sort of ritualised payback. Port Keats was a settlement in which 29 or so separate tribal groups were aggregated. With the collocation of groups that had always been mutually hostile, everyMontague found a variety of Capulets; Capulets found Montagues of all stripes; andall parties obliged the colonists with \"payback\" without end.The newspapers describe a community whose elders have failed. Ruined by alcohol and disappointment, they have lost all self-respect and have failed to gain the respect of the young. The town abides in paralysis, terrorised by its teenagers.That is the story I read down south.My employers in the Remote Health Service in Darwin treat me to a session of cultural orientation before my term in Wadeye. The doctor, a veteran of outback Aboriginal health, explains the gang warfare differently: \"What happens in Wadeye is nothing like payback. In communities as traditional as Wadeye, payback is determined by due process, which is quite exhaustive.\"What happens on the streets of Port Keats is emphatically different. The Wadeye stuff is imitative of gang life, in the style of American movies.\"Indeed, I read that the gangs in Wadeye style themselves Judas Priest and Warriors, and more latterly, German Punk. My mentor adds, \"These kids are out at night because there is no room for them in their houses. There might be 30 people in a three-bedroom house, with three sleeping shifts around the clock. \"The teenagers grab some sleep during the day. Then here they are atnight, awake, energised and presentlyhomeless.\"They join gangs for something to do. An outlet for testosterone, a need to belong when they don't belong at home.\"Fellow travellersAt the airport, I am unprepared for the heat. I choose to sit inside where noisy aircon battles the temperature. Seated along a wall, two school-aged girls, an aged lady, and a pair of older men - all Aboriginal - share the cool with me. It is the aged lady who first takes my eye. She has a rich snowfall of hair, the caramel skin that would have seen her stolen in childhood as a \"half-breed\", and an upright deportment that speaks of grace and authority. She looks just like my hero ladies, the Strong Women of Galiwin'ku. She is in fact very good-looking, a judgment not diminished by the snowy bristle on her chin.The old lady is cradling a newborn baby in its swaddling. The baby is quiet in her arms. The two teenagers next to her whisper busily to each other, drink Coke, send text messages and chew their gum. One girl wears cheap-looking Carlton Football Club merchandise, the other is a Brisbane Lion. I am trying to decide who is the baby's mother. It is not easy: the girls seem too young, too slight, too innocently childlike; the old lady looks old.The blokes are tall and thin, not young. One of them is a well-made man with long arms hanging loosely from his muscled shoulders. With his reach, he'd have made a formidable boxer. The man has abundant hair, great waves of charcoal, grey and white, falling in wild harmony about his head. He has the bearing of a personage.He rises and crosses the room in my direction. His gait is abnormal. He rolls as one on a ship's deck, steadying himself against a tricky ocean swell; a step forward and another, a pause to sway and regain balance, then another flurry of quick steps, before checking his progress and regaining equilibrium. It's a short passage of ballet, rhythmic, distinctive, somehow dignified. It is a neurological consequence of a toxin, possibly alcohol, possibly petrol.In all his human wreckage, this man is arrestingly good-looking. He sits down a metre from me and says \"Hello\" in a baritone voice rich and rattling with echoes oftobacco.My mouth is full of the fruit I'm eating. I return a fruity hello and proffer my bag of citrus. He accepts a piece of fruit, extends his neck and looks it over, then asks, \"What'sthis?\"I tell him, \"A mandarin.\"The old man - I guess he's 50 - gets up and flows into movement, negotiates the dance floor between me and the women and the baby and sits down. Wordlessly, he passes the mandarin to the Brisbane Lion, she passes him one of the cigarettes she's been rolling, and the girls and the man step outside and have a smoke. Then they come strolling and waltzing back inside. The three sit down and my small mandarin is shared between themselves and my Strong Woman.A thin voice from outside calls us for theflight.A new mumWe climb aboard and choose seats at random. I have an aisle seat, immediately behind Carlton girl, who it is now clear is the young mother, and the mandarin man. Deftly, gently, the old bloke threads the baby's seat belting around the swaddling. We take off and for 40 minutes I study one of Australia's newest citizens in the sole care of one of our newest mums.The baby has round black cheeks, pursed dark cherry lips, outlined by traces of drying breast milk. The baby is a winning miniature of the mother, who wears his rounded features in leaner, linear form. Forty minutes is not too long a time to look at the baby.The aircraft is not pressurised. We ascend and descend and the baby never stirs. The mother's face is inches from the baby, her eyes fixed on the small face. When the brilliant sunlight shines on him, Carlton girl shades his eyes with her small hand. At intervals, the mother's slender fingers caress the air over the baby's cheeks. The urge to touch the exquisite flesh wrestles with the wish to preserve his perfect rest.The local doctor picks me up and takes me to his house, which will be my house while he is away. It is enclosed in a cage among a cluster of cages. We members of the aviary are the whitefellas, our cages are residences with barred windows and enclosed verandas. We cluster, I gather, for safety. The idea is that a worker - often a nurse or a teacher, often young and female - should be safe and should feel safe.I feel too safe for comfort. But towards evening and in the early mornings the stout wooden palings create a delicate sculpture of light and shade in my veranda. The penitentiary space of concrete and wooden bars becomes a place of serenity. In the mornings and before sunset I come out to the dappled light to recite my prayers - shaharit and mincha - in unexpected tranquillity.I haven't been here long - in fact I haven't yet reported for duty - when a banging and a thumping on my bars and a roaring voice disturb my Sunday quiet. The voice calls, \"Howard! Howard! Are you there?\"Emergency greetingI am. It is my boss, the clinic chief. He has alot of hair, a shaggy leonine face and a warm handclasp. \"Howard, can you come to the clinic, now? We've got a woman about to give birth. There are complications. I'm Stuart, by the way.\"\"Howard. Good to meet you.\"It's a short drive from cage to clinic, but long enough to learn our patient is about to deliver, she has received no antenatal care at all and she is anaemic. The air medical service promised to send a doctor and a nurse, but only the latter has materialised.We jump from the ute. We enter the modern building, a monster. Passing rapidly through deserted rooms we head for the emergency room. I will find this clinic building to be the largest I have worked in - anywhere in the world. (I sense here the fruit ofsome spasm of whitefella reaction; has some politician, embarrassed by reporting of disgraceful neglect, promised largely and spent wildly?)In Aboriginal Australia it is preferred that a man should not attend a woman in childbirth. It is women's business; its private and secret nature transcends coyness but includes shame.I stand at the rear of the room, the patient sheltered from my view (and from my assistance) by curtains pulled around her. A wrinkled white face atop a small frame smiles across the room at me and the lady identifies herself as Holly, the clinic midwife. \"I'm glad you are here. Her haemoglobin is only 60percent. We don't want a bleed.\"Between curtain cracks I witness the expert delivery of a baby that bawls its own birth announcement. I examine her. She is chubby, mature, perfect.Meanwhile, her mother is haemorrhaging. The placenta is stuck and we must wait. A nurse brings me a mask, gown, gloves in preparation for an emergency procedure called Manual Removal of the Placenta. This, of course, is a manual removal of all dignity and privacy, invasive and painful; and it carries its own dangers.Highly competent Holly pulls patiently and gently on the cord. Nothing budges. Blood flows; how much of the mother's 60per cent remains? Her vital signs remain stable. We wait while the blood pools.Presently, Holly's patient traction is rewarded with the arrival of a complete and healthy placenta. The bleeding slows, then stops. Soon a Flying Doctor arrives and takes mum and baby back to the city hospital, where mum will receive a couple of pints ofblood.I have witnessed one skirmish in the Uprising. No one lost. Did anyone win? Certainly the clinic, ostensibly a non-obstetric facility, functioned very well in an obstetric emergency. All the equipment you might need for midwifery is here, stored discreetly away from public gaze. The clinic is not supposed to be delivering babies, but, in circumstances of familiar ambiguity, reality contends with policy. Half supported - there is no blood here for transfusion - stoic nurses quietly do their heroic best.Night falls at the end of my first day here. My neighbour in Wadeye, a white lady who has worked here for years, calls me: \"Don't leave your vehicle parked outside overnight. The kids congregate for fighting quite close by. Your car will be a great temptation, an alternative to a fight for bored kids.\"Meeting the neighboursThen she adds, \"Come over to my place and meet the neighbours.\"I spend pleasant hours in the company of a couple of schoolteachers, a bloke who cooks for the kids at the school, some nurses and the woman who runs the Women's Centre. As far as I can see, no married couples. The outback is hard on marriage.Liberal amounts of food and bonhomie, affectionate in-jokes, laughter and conversation relieve a difficult reality. We are gathered here, behind prudent fences, and not quite within the community we serve. The gathering is not dry.Conversation flows, shedding snippets of difficult reality: \"cheeky dogs\"; \"school, hunger, houses\"; \"the takeaway\"; \"women, safety, fighting\".\"How long will you be with us, Howard?\"The question is prompted by need. I dash any hope with the truth: \"Five minutes.\"\"So, you're not going to replace the doctor when he leaves us for good?\"\"No, I'm just a locum.\"\"That's a shame. It's hard to attract doctors to Wadeye. What made you comehere?\"\"I met a midwife in the Kimberley, named Rachel. She used to work here in Wadeye. She told me about the 50 babies born safely here. I didn't know whether to feel excited or alarmed, so I came to see for myself.\"I tell them about the childbirth that I witnessed this afternoon, the calm teamwork, the expertise, the anaemic mother giving birth for the fourth time.\"She had had no antenatal care at all.\"This statement is received with a shaking of knowing heads. Fourth time around, a mother would understand something of the risk. She'd have hidden herself from notice, determined to give birth in her own country. I remark, \"If Rachel is right, we could run a safe midwifery service out here for selected patients who had normal pregnancies.\"This provokes a passionate response from the midwife seated next to me.\"I'm sorry - Rachel's a lovely girl - but her paper is dangerous! Women will believe they can stay away from hospitals because it was safe for those others. But it's not safe. Excepting for low-risk pregnancies. And very few of them are low-risk!\"Strong women to foreThis is one of a number of strongly felt views that I hear at my neighbour's. Those who hold them are all women. Wadeye is a place where I will encounter forthright opinions delivered by a number of strong women. Unfortunately, this cadre of Strong Women in Wadeye is all white.I do come across one exception. Outside the store, I pass an aged lady. She has long white hair that falls to her shoulders like a nun's wimple. Her face is a map of desert country, her spine is bent forward and to her left. As a result her gait is slow and spidery, her legs propelling her forward while her head and body face left. In the old measure, she'd be well under five foot tall.It is not her physiognomy that strikes me so much as her expression of obdurate resolution: she knows what needs to be done and she will do it. She leans on a stick as she walks and she holds the hand of a very small child, leading her, pulling her past the store with its blandishments, through the thronging idlers and smokers and cool teens with attitude. All these make way for the old lady and her charge. The two proceed in the direction of the Women's Centre.The Women's Centre is a revelation. Here, women weave mats and baskets in traditional materials and paint and print in gloriously untraditional media. Beneath soaring roofs of galvanised iron, great bolts of bold printed cloth hang from beams. Prints of great beauty hang on the walls. All of this is the work of local women, some of whom are away at present, in residence at Bachelor College, where they are learning advanced printing and silk painting techniques.The work takes me by surprise, its beauty and its ambition - and it's not too much to say, its grandeur - all belie the sheer ordinariness of the building's exterior. It is a tin shed. And it is a treasure house.\"But, some of the artists are too scared to come here,\" - thus the director, my neighbour of last night - \"sometimes their menfolk are jealous and keep them away.\"\"Why would they be jealous?\"\"Their women gain confidence and independence here. They keep 50per cent of any sales. Some men resent that. They keep their women away through fear.\" Lethargy in the sunIn the sunlit streets, there is a general dawdling. No one over the age of five moves with alacrity. The elderly and infirm move slowly, so too the able-bodied, adult and child alike. No one is in a hurry. What is more, no one is going anywhere.In this young town, kids are everywhere, the small ones skinny of limb, round of face, the teenagers tall and lean, all in AFL uniform. Although we are in school hours, hundreds of children linger around the entrances of the supermarket and the takeaway. While school is open, children are not admitted to the shops. But they appear answerable to no one.There is an abiding passivity. Three thousand people live here. I locate the hairdresser's shop. It has closed down. The gym is barred closed. The town has no taxi, no drycleaner, no internet cafe, no cafe of any sort. In this verdant coastal wetland no one markets or processes fish, no one runs an orchard or a market garden.In two weeks in the community, I fail to identify a single Aboriginal enterprise.I walk the sad streets and the passivity overtakes me. I am in the slough of despond. After three days I call my brother back in the city. I tell him what I see. He catches the pain in my voice. Desperate, he shouts into the phone, \"Why don't they fix it?\"I explain, wearily, almost apologetically, that they try, that we try; that none of us knows how to \"fix it\", that we cannot fix it, but we cannot desist from trying. My brother has caught the sound of a pain that is not really mine; I have appropriated it.I am taken by the body habitus of the locals. No one is fat. The small children delight the eye. Human miniatures, everything about them is small excepting for large smiles and abundant hair. Their adolescent siblings are slender and erect.It is difficult to behold the young of Wadeye without a shock of delight. But a cruel reality hides behind the beauty. Why are the people so slim? How can this community achieve such enviable body shape? The answer is infant starvation.Hungry childrenThis is not my opinion. In fact it is no one's opinion. It is declared as manifest fact by nurses, by teachers, by community workers - all of them women - all angered by starvation on our own shores. They speak of a literal food chain where children do not sit high. A senior teacher explains: \"Some of these kids get no reliable feeding except at school. We feed them breakfast, morning tea and a cooked lunch. That's the main reason school attendance here is so high.\"\"How high is it?\"\"Thirty per cent. Nine hundred kids are enrolled and on any given day 300 come toschool.\"On these figures the majority misses school. But a third attend \"on any given day\".\"Who comes to school?\"\"All ages - from five to 21. Some will come one day, some another. One will come for an entire week, then disappear for weeks. Sometimes I'll notice that one of my regular girls hasn't been here for a while and I'll inquire, 'Where's Josie?' And her friends will say, 'Josie has a boyfriend.' From that I am to understand that Josie's schooling is over. The girls stop coming to school as soon as they have a boyfriend.\"I arrange to visit the school. I want to see what happens at a school where the way to a person's mind is through his stomach. It is the senior children whose lunchtime I witness. These children are 12 to 15 years old, not yet married, not yet matriculated into a couple or to coupling.The food looks nourishing and appetising. The kids line up, each holding a bowl. Cooked white rice is dolloped into the bowl, then a lashing of chicken curry. Every child receives starch, fat, protein and flavour. After this they eat sliced orange segments.Children wait their turn, they line up, many are coaxed into saying \"thank you\" audibly. According to Teacher Betty, a forthright idealist, \"thank you\" is one of the longer sentences in English she'll hear from her students. I ask Betty, \"How many of your senior class can converse in English?\" \"None. Perhaps one. Sentences are oneword.\"After lunch, every student scrapes waste into the bin. A monitor, selected for the task following some recent infraction, washes the dishes while another delinquent wipes down the tables with studied accuracy.All this takes place under the hard, clear eye of Magdalena, who might be the vice-principal. Magdalena says she is half-Serbian and half-Scottish. I watch her in action: she is 100per cent tough love. A sexual health lessonMagdalena informs me that I am to return tomorrow to give the senior boys and the senior girls a health talk. Separately. She wants me to teach them about sexual health. The rivers of venereal pus flow deep and broad up here (just as they do back in the whitefella south). If one-word sentences are the go here, that word should be condom.Next day, I walk to the front of the class. The whitefella teacher introduces me. The boys take no notice: Pandemonium fights with apathy. Apathy wins. One boy, seated immediately beneath my nose, keeps his back to me, giving me the John Howard treatment. Is it because of my name?The teacher retreats and returns with reinforcements. His reinforcers are two Aboriginal men, one in his 40s, the other in his 50. They stand at opposite sides of the class and berate the boys. And berate them.What should I tell the boys? I decide to ask them what they want to know. \"What do you want to know about sex?\"Silence. I ask the question in sign language. This is a hit. I have chosen a sign that bridges the seven languages of Wadeye and trounces the Queen's English.Uproar. Pandemonium beats apathy pants down. The berators quieten the class.The school is called OLSH. I decode this. It means Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. It is against school policy, it seems, to use the word \"condom\". From my bag I draw a banana. I have a condom from the clinic supply. The condom is black. I produce a banana, purchased by means of a personal loan. I have their attention now. I apply the condom to the banana. I do not speak of contraception, not of respect for women, nor of responsibility. Instead I say: \"This one\" (indicating the condom) \"keeps this one\" (indicating the central part of the front of my pants) \"strong. When you put on this one\" (pointing again to the condom), \"that one\" (pointing at my pants front) \"doesn't get germs. Stays strong.\"Now I pull out a red can of cola and a bottle of water. \"Which one is the healthy one?\"\"Water!\" in one voice.\"What's wrong with the red one?\" I ask.\"Sugar!\"To which I add, \"If you drink the red one every day, you can get diabetes. If you get diabetes, one day, this one [indicating the same area at the front of my pants] is not strong. Doesn't work. No sex. Never - no sex.\"A pause for dramatic effect.A voice from one of the bigger boys, addresses the body of the class, not the guest: \"I drink the red one. Do plenty sex.\"So much for my attempt to improve sexual health among the boys who will be men in Wadeye.\"Without a change in male behaviour, women will contract their men's diseases endlessly.\" Thus the women's health doctor, a tall tawny lady who pulls no punches, takes no prisoners, especially not from this southern pipsqueak. I ask a question: \"What if a woman were to say, 'If it's not on, it's not on'?\"I made no assertion, merely asked a diffident question - but the doctor jabs the air at me as she gives me THE FACTS.\"Women here are completely objectified. They could never demand that their partner use a condom. They mightn't even be asked for consent. It is the men who have tochange!\"Back at the school, I visit the girls' senior class. The girls sit in ladylike stillness, a larger group than the boys, all attentive.They are not talking; I have their attention. But they are shy.I want to leave the girls with something useful, something that can help them when they matriculate to boyfriends. Magdalena passes me a piece of paper on which she has written: NO CONDOMS!!!This is OLSH. I am forbidden here to talk about contraception. Bananas and condoms are out of the question. What will I talkabout? Keeping a secretThen it hits me - sex is secret. It is secrets that I must talk about. Standing next to me is Roxanne, the sexual health nurse, who has come with me from the clinic.I start, \"A woman's body is her secret. I cannot talk about that secret. The nurse - pointing to Roxanne - can talk about it. She knows secret things. She can see you alone, at the clinic, with the door closed. She will keep your secrets.\"The girls seem to be listening. I want to talk about sex, about consent, about feelings, and of course I cannot. I continue, \"Sometimes a boy wants sex with a girl and she doesn't want it. Maybe he does it anyway.\"He makes her do sex. Then that girl can see the nurse about those secret things. Maybe a boy hurts a girl, maybe she gets sick in her woman's parts, inside her body. The nurse knows about all those secret things. If a woman wants a baby, the nurse can help. If she doesn't want a baby yet - maybe she is too young - the nurse can help her. At the clinic. All that secret business.\"I've finished. Three women nod emphatically, meaningfully. The three are Teacher Betty, Magdalena and Lucy, the activities officer. The schoolgirls have been polite and attentive. I cannot know whether I have been useful or just another old whitefella who comes, speaks incomprehensibly and goes away.This essay first appeared in the Griffith Review It is excerpted from a longer work that will appear in Howard Goldenberg's forthcoming book, Burned Man , due early 2015. www.howardgoldenberg.comAlso in Weekend Fin Tomorrow, the world The digital giants are building palatial new HQs - but what do these displays of power mean for us?

Of the two main roads, O'Connell Street is the more commercial, with a retail mall, supermarkets, restaurants and pubs as well as boutiques while Melbourne Street is on a smaller scale and boutiques, cafes, restaurants and an award-winning pub.WHERE TO EATThe Daniel O'Connell Pub &amp; Dining Room, at 165 Tynte Street, harks back to a bygone era. It serves traditional Irish fare - ox heart, lamb sweetbreads, pork hock, blood pudding - that has had a makeover. The less adventurous can opt for local seafood and more familiar cuts of meat. And best of all, even though it's an open-plan dining area, it's quiet enough to hold a normal conversation with your dining companions. The wine list is comprehensive, with excellent wines by the glass, and the wait staff are knowledgeable and helpful.The Lion, 161 Melbourne Street, doesn't roar so much as buzz. The hotel's restaurant has won multiple awards for its \"mod Oz\" dishes, while Lion Express is an upmarket version of bar food that does breakfast, lunch and dinner. A weekly special might be prawns and Singapore noodles, and an old-fashioned mixed grill never looked so good. There are multiple dining areas, including on the wide, tree-lined footpath.WHERE TO STAYIn the smaller but buzzy main drag is the Minima Hotel, at 146 Melbourne Street (majestic hotels.com.au). The hotel's 46 rooms are canvases for established and emerging contemporary artists. The rooms are small, but through an intelligent use of space they pack a lot of punch: king-size bed, stylish bathroom, free Wi-Fi, balcony, desk, fridge, iron and board, safe, crockery and cutlery.It's an affordable hotel that doesn't compromise on design or comfort. However, rooms on one side look onto a car park and apartment block. The floor to ceiling windows are covered by a heavy curtain and when it's open, nothing at all - a simple solution would be a lightweight curtain that lets in light and maintains privacy.To keep rates low, rooms are only serviced every four days and a concierge is only on site from 2pm to 10pm. If you arrive outside these times there's a handset in the entrance that connects to the desk of a nearby Majestic property where someone can check you in.

We agree - everyone, get online and have a peek.Lynch and his wife are a close partnership, as AFL Commission chairman Mike Fitzpatrick explained when he announced in February that friend of the column Kim Williams was replacing Lynch at as an AFL commissioner.Seary's blog is a helpful way for staff at her procurement businesses in Melbourne to keep track of the boss.Our favourite post is a list titled \"Aspirations\". It includes a Bentley GT (\"We all need goals,\" Seary observes), St Regis Resort Bali (\"heaven, luxury, privacy, seclusion, cocktails\") and Lake Como (\"lead the life of the jet-set Europeans and take your summer holiday 'by the lake'\").With such shiny goals, we wish her luck in her business and her hubby's efforts to achieve the up to 120 per cent bonus on his \u00c2\u00a3800,000 salary.", "AFR_1027": "The unprecedented and aggressive decision by the United States to charge five officers in the infamous Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with crimes including hacking, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and deploying viruses to damage protected computers is an enormous escalation in the \"cyber cold war\" between the US and its two main digital rivals, China and Russia.Crucially, expect much more to come. This is just an early skirmish in a campaign that is unlikely to end.Of course, China vehemently denied all accusations. They might want to try the more credible line given to this newspaper by the former director of the CIA, General Michael Hayden: \"We steal other country's secrets - and frankly we're quite good at it.\" General Hayden argues, however, that the US does not engage in industrial espionage, which many, including Britain and Australia's top spies, claim China does.'Blackshades'On the same day the FBI announced \"the results of a cyber takedown\" with charges laid against the co-developers of a \"particularly insidious [malicious software] known as Blackshades, which infected \"more than half a million computers worldwide\". The FBI said the operation involved 19 countries and more than 90 arrests.The FBI said the Blackshades Remote Access Tool allowed \"criminals to steal passwords and banking credentials; hack into social media accounts; access documents, photos, and other computer files; record all keystrokes; activate webcams; hold a computer for ransom; and use the computer in distributed denial of service attacks\".Momentum in the simmering global cyber-security contest, in which there are few agreed norms between states, swung savagely against the US in June 2013 following the heist of over 100,000 classified documents by the fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Suddenly America, ranked by Freedom House as providing among the strongest civil liberties, privacies and media freedoms in the world, became the biggest global surveillance threat. In contrast, China and Russia, which sit at 176 and 179 in Freedom House's list of global press freedoms, have been lauded for offering Snowden protection.Awkwardly, Snowden disclosed that when gathering intelligence on foreign threats, the NSA works actively in co-operation with \"strategic\" commercial partners including Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, AT&amp;T, IBM, Motorola, Google, Facebook and Yahoo!, among others.While Snowden says he is bravely prepared to take full responsibility for his actions, and stole the largest trove of intelligence secrets in US history simply to allow the public to decide what is in their best interests, he has relentlessly sought to evade the reach of the US judicial system.As outgoing NSA boss General Keith Alexander explained in an interview with The Australian Financial Review, many crucial questions remain unanswered in the Snowden story. The sensational action by the US government to charge five PLA officers is almost certainly an attempt to hit back at Chinese and Russian collaboration with Snowden.It was to a Chinese territory, Hong Kong, that Snowden fled. It was China that prevented the US from leveraging off its extradition treaty with Hong Kong while Snowden was there. It was Russia's consulate in which Snowden hid on his final two nights in Hong Kong, and Russia that has offered him sanctuary ever since.Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, sits on the oversight board of the Russian successor security agency to the KGB.He says Snowden is protected by Russian bodyguards, is financed by Russian philanthropists and is considering seeking Russian citizenship. Yes, the final Snowden story has yet to be written.", "AFR_107": "His suit is Zegna, his shirt Saba, his shoes Prada and he knows David Jones like the back of his hand.But that's where the similarities end between David Jones's new chief executive, Paul Zahra, and his disgraced former boss, Mark McInnes.As McInnes yesterday denied allegations of sexually harassing a second employee, Zahra distanced himself from the behaviour that destroyed the once brilliant retail career of his long-time friend and colleague.\"How do I give you confidence it won't happen with me? I have a partner I've been with for 20 years and I'm in a very solid relationship,\" \u00c2\u00adZahra told The Australian Financial Review in an exclusive interview \u00c2\u00adyesterday.\"I'm highly principled and have strong values -- if you asked anybody that's what they would say of me.\"That's the type of character that made me successful in my previous jobs and I see that actually translating well into the chief executive's role.\"Zahra, who turned 44 at the weekend, pledged to continue McInnes's successful house of brands strategy until 2012, when a new three-year plan will be unveiled.Zahra has been groomed to take over as chief executive since 2003, when he took charge of store operations, merchandising and human resources for David Jones, overseeing about 8000 staff.But neither Zahra nor the David Jones board could have foreseen the circumstances that would lead to his premature appointment.McInnes, 45, quit David Jones and left Australia last Friday after making sexual advances to a female staff member, who is expected to take action against the company through her lawyers, Harmers Workplace Lawyers.\"Does anything prepare you for what we've just been through in the last week? Absolutely not,\" says Zahra.\"I'm personally sad and disappointed about what's happened with Mark because I've had a personal and professional relationship with him,\" he says.\"He's also obviously disappointed in himself and he's taken accountability for his actions, the board has also taken accountability, they've moved swiftly and we want to pick ourselves up and move on.\"With the retailer's strategic plan for the next two years firmly in place, Zahra says his first priority as chief executive will be reassure David Jones's 10,000 staff.He has ordered an independent review of the employee hotline that was set up specifically to uncover staff harrassment and bullying - and yet which failed to alert the board to Mark McInnes's behaviour - and is preparing a major presentation to staff later this week.\"I'll be leading by example,\" says Zahra. \"People should have confidence this will be my No. 1 priority given the potentially damaging nature of it,\" he said.\"We're also concerned about making sure we manage any individual who has been hurt or damaged in any way - part of that is about protecting their privacy and making sure we follow good process.\"However, Zahra, who lives in Sydney's inner-city Potts Point and walks to work every morning after his daily workout in the gym, plans to take a much lower public profile than his predecessor, whose fondness for fashion parades, luxury product launches and race days contributed to his undoing.Melbourne-born Zahra, whose family originally came from Malta, believes the cult of the celebrity CEO has gone too far.\"It's the same with celebrity chefs and celebrity DJs - it's not the way I see myself or the way I behave. I'm going to prove [myself] to everybody through my results, that's all,\" he says.\"It's about the brand, not me.\"Zahra, who started working in retail at the age of 16 as a sales assistant at Target and completed the Stanford executive program at Stanford University in 2007, is keen to put his own stamp on the business.He worked his way up through the ranks at Target in the 1980s and 1990s, opening Target's first CBD store in Melbourne before joining Mark McInnes and Stephen Goddard, David Jones's long-serving finance director, at Officeworks and following them to David Jones in 1998.\"I've only ever done retailing, I love retailing and I'm passionate about David Jones,\" says Zahra.\"In simple terms I like people walking in with a full wallet and walking out with less in it.\"But Zahra is keeping his plans close to his chest until 2012, when the new strategic plan for 2013 to 2016 will be revealed.\"I see opportunities and they will come past the current plan,\" he says.Zahra has no plans to take David Jones further upmarket, even though he is most inspired by department stores Selfridges in the UK and Bloomingdales in the US.The Australian market is too small, he says, to cater to a single wealthy demographic.The beauty of David Jones's current three-tiered \"house of brands'' strategy is that customers can buy a $15 lipstick under David Jones's own brand or a $400 jar of Creme de la Mer.\"With the brand portfolio we've captured the best national and international brands, the team has mastered that and from my perspective there will be no change,\" he says.\"We want to get people shopping with us every week.\"He sees scope for further cost cutting and is confident in the retailer's ability to deliver 5 to 10 per cent net profit growth through the economic cycle by pulling harder or softer on the costs lever.However, he has no plans to take advantage of McInnes's premature departure to clear the decks or take write-downs on aged inventory, which remains below the retailers' 5 per cent benchmark.\"We have some short-term issues in managing the current climate and that's my priority, but its business as usual,\" he says.\"There is nothing that I would stop doing that we're doing today.\"Trading during the first two weeks of David Jones's winter clearance program has been good and the retailer has reaffirmed its second-half profit guidance.David Jones shares have shed only 4\u00c2\u00a2 since McInnes's departure and Zahra's appointment, closing yesterday at $4.47 compared with $4.51 last week.While some analysts believe the circumstances of McInnes's departure will damage the David Jones brand and investor confidence, others believe the quick response of the board in appointing a well regarded insider will limit the fallout.\"He's been part of the management team for the last 12 years so we're relatively comfortable without personally meeting him as yet - he's the board's appointment so you have to believe the board as well,\" said Aberdeen Asset Management's head of equities, Mark Daniels.", "AFR_1017": "Here's another clue why competition is coming back in mortgages, apart from the demand driven by low interest rates. Seemingly against the odds, says UBS, the biggest contributor to the big banks' profits is lending to households, despite rock-bottom lending growth from the financial crisis until late last year.It says the post-crisis reduction in competition - caused by soaring wholesale debt funding costs post- GFC and commercial loans turning bad leading to big banks gobbling up failing rivals - allowed the big banks to make enough hikes in interest rates to overwhelm those historically high, but declining, funding costs. The banks also drove down other costs.Analysis by UBS's Jonathan Mott and Chris Williams of NAB, ANZ Bank and Commonwealth Bank shows retail lending accounts for 35 to 40 per cent of their profits, with profit from this area doubling for the three from about $3.5 billion in 2007 to an estimate of more than $7 billion for the 2013-14 financial year.They say CBA, for instance, made most of its money from deposits seven years ago when interest rates on deposits were negligible. Then it was about 51 per cent of revenue while home loans was 26 per cent.That's now flipped to 42 per cent from mortgages and 26 per cent from deposits. The difference is mainly made up of growth in other personal loans from 22 to 27 per cent.That's because regulations and expensive offshore debt markets have made deposits a much bigger source of funding for banks and term-deposit rates jumped with the competition for these. At the same time as the number of new household loans has been at record lows, CBA's revenue from households grew at a 15 per cent compound annual growth rate.Record profitsMott and Williams also found the profitability of each new loan is at record levels - at least for CBA. While this fell sharply as term deposit and other costs rose, post-crisis, it now is about 0.67 per cent compared with between 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent a decade ago. But it can't last.Yellow Brick Road executive chairman Mark Bouris, among others, is eyeing fat mortgage profits and has decided the conditions are right to siphon off a bit. He's being joined by Macquarie Bank and other small lenders that have suffered from high funding costs caused by the GFC, extra regulations and the flight to the perceived safety of the four pillars.Mott and Williams say high profits will last at least 12 months, but believe the margins on retail loans are unsustainable with the return of competition and the impact of new comprehensive credit reporting rules that came in on March 12.The Attorney-General probably made these less effective on Wednesday by applying to the Privacy Commissioner to extend the grace period for reporting late loan repayments from five to 14 days.But combined with national consumer credit protection laws that compel banks to use all means to assess a borrower's ability to repay, over the next three to five years Mott and WIlliams say the credit reporting rules should give far more data to smaller lenders, letting them pick up new borrowers.", "AFR_1081": "Electricity retailers have cheered a decision by the NSW government to allow the voluntary rollout of smart meters, avoiding the consumer backlash that marred their mandatory introduction in Victoria.NSW Resources and Energy Minister Anthony Roberts revealed on Tuesday that retailers may offer the new digital meters, which allow flexible pricing of electricity, but households can also keep their existing meter.The introduction of smart meters allows for a move towards cost-reflective pricing, in which electricity prices vary depending on the changing cost of supply through the day. They have been generally supported by the energy supply industry and allow consumers and suppliers to access up-to-date information on electricity use to better manage delivery and use.The compulsory rollout of the meters in Victoria in 2009 led to a consumer revolt, due to the upfront costs of installation that were charged to households, concerns about health impacts and privacy, and other issues.In NSW, electricity retailers will be able to offer smart meters to customers as part of competitive energy supply deals, Mr Roberts said. He said the rollout \"is the NSW government's next step in putting the power firmly into the hands of electricity customers\".Retailers support new technologyMajor retailer Origin Energy said the voluntary framework would \"lead to better outcomes for both parties\" and help remove cross-subsidies between different types of energy consumer.EnergyAustralia's head of retail, Adrian Merrick, said smart meters would have significant benefits and that the company would look at opportunities to provide them to customers.AGL Energy said a commercially driven rollout would \"result in digital metering services that consumers want because it provides flexibility for retailers like AGL and other parties to innovate and develop new products and services to offer to customers.\"The government's energy green paper pointed to the need for the smart meters to enable the reform of power supply tariffs, which would improve the long-term efficiency of the system.They should allow better control of energy usage and costs, easier connections and disconnections for people moving house and a wider range of pricing tariffs. Consumers could choose whether to have bills charged fortnightly, monthly or quarterly.At present, all household electricity meters in NSW are owned by state-owned power distribution networks. They are mechanical and need to be read manually every 90 days. Smart meters are digital and range from basic systems that provide real-time information and improved billing options to advanced ones that can be remotely controlled by mobile devices.", "AFR_1055": "I am conducting my own commission of audit - on my personal credit rating. Alert readers may recall my interest was piqued after I was knocked back for a David Jones American Express card earlier this year. A polite letter informed me that following inquiries with credit reporting agency Veda, my application was rejected. Harrumph.Not that I really needed another credit card. The lure had been more about the instant discount offered on what I was buying and a persistently well-meaning sales assistant recommending I apply immediately.Still, there's nothing like rejection to stiffen a sense of self-righteousness - and my own unnatural curiosity.This eventually led me to the North Sydney office of Veda to discover all sorts of information held about myself. Like most people, I was inexcusably ignorant of how all this was accumulated - and the fact that there will soon be even more details available on everyone's credit and payment history.New rules that took effect in March (hilariously known as the new privacy laws) mean that being more than 14 days late paying a credit card, for example, will automatically appear on someone's credit record and remain there for years.Now I did vaguely know that applying for credit cards or loans or mortgages automatically involved some sort of credit check. What I didn't know is that every person in Australia is given a score between 0 and 1200. The average personal score at Veda is apparently 749 - which suggests credit rating agencies do have a sense of humour after all. A numbers gameAnd there's another mysterious cut-off line - Veda wouldn't tell me the precise figure - below which an individual's chance of getting a credit card or a loan from a reputable source like a big bank are slim to none.Now I concede I was never going to be a role model for official credit worthiness, even in my, ahem, more mature financial phase.A protracted and unfortunate history of sometimes forgetting to make even the minimum credit card payments on time meshes with occasional vicious disputes with companies ranging from video stores to phone companies to electricity providers. Naturally, I usually consider myself to be morally correct in disputes over bills and it's not as if the bank didn't fine me for late payments. Or indeed make a lot of extra interest over the years when I couldn't pay my debts in full every month.In this case, I finally discovered the cause of my problem was an argument with Vodafone dating back a year and relating to a son's mobile phone bill overseas. (Sound familiar?)After admittedly heated conversations, the matter had already been resolved, mainly in my favour. (My son is still paying me back the difference, of course.) Apparently this correction didn't make it into the records of the credit agency.Thus I became a credit accident waiting to happen.That it's now sorted out is thanks only to my previous column on the subject. I am now the proud owner of a credit score of 915, which I am told puts me in the top 20 per cent credit ranking. It's likely to be my peak performance - before another bill fracas inevitably intervenes.All's well that ends creditably, I guess. Not that I will be trying Amex again. But what happens to people who either don't know, or don't publicly reveal, their own personal credit humiliations. Or who have a rather less lengthy employment history and record of - relative - financial stability. Sure, bad debts or even late payments are not to be encouraged as either a regular business or a personal proposition. It's also unreasonable to suggest individuals should be able to get away with simply not paying bills while being able to turn up as financial cleanskins when applying for more credit. The cost of bad debts gets shared around the community.They're not always rightBut credit agencies do sometimes get things wrong. Or they are not provided with the information to correct mistakes.My personal credit file, for example, correctly had various past home addresses even I could hardly remember but also recorded me as a former accountant at John Fairfax Publications. If that were true, it might help explain some of the company's financial decline over the years. But that is a comparatively innocuous error. However, I could have gone on indefinitely, unaware I also had a big black mark courtesy of my phone bill.The commercial response, unsurprisingly, is to present another business opportunity. Veda, for example, provides credit details, including any changes, for a monthly fee. Anyone refused credit within the previous three months can also apply for a less-detailed personal credit file for free - though minus the personal credit score. According to Veda, 80 per cent of people have never checked their credit history - possibly because 53 per cent don't know how to access it and 81 per cent are not concerned about the issue.Perhaps they should be. Credit providers now want to make a more nuanced distinction between their version of good and bad behaviour. Previously, credit agencies could only keep records of credit applications and \"negative\" events like defaults, court judgments and bankruptcies. Under new \"positive\" reporting (yet more wonderful terminology), extra information includes the date of accounts opened and closed, the type of credit and credit limits and two years worth of repayment history. After complaints, the grace period for late payment being recorded is extended from five days to 14. Sigh. I already feel an argument coming on.", "AFR_1005": "Former foreign minister Alexander Downer has put his Adelaide Hills family home up for sale as he prepares to move ito digs provided by his new job as high commissioner to Britain.Mr Downer hopes for a price \"over $1.2 million\" for the five-bedroom, two-bathroom home in the heart of his former electorate of Mayo, Toop &amp; Toop agent Arabella Cooper said on Tuesday.Set on 1000 hectares of hilly ground, the one-storey house with gardens that Mr Downer's wife Nicky has tended, offers great privacy just 20 minutes up the South Eastern Freeway from Adelaide. It is the second time Mr Downer has put the house on the market. It failed to sell in 2008, The Australian Financial Review understands, a year after the Coalition government in which he was foreign minister from 1996 to 2007, was voted out of office.Since then, the Downers have renovated the kitchen and main bathroom. The property has a pool, tennis court and spring-fed dam and views north-east over the Onkaparinga Valley.The rooms have restored timber doors and several rooms have parquet floors. Their four children no longer live at home. Swapping Brampton House - named after the Derbyshire town where Mrs Downer was born - for Australia House will be a homecoming of sorts.Mr Downer's father, Sir Alec Downer, was high commissioner to Britain for eight years to 1972, so he no doubt knows that property well.The move also permits a family reunion as the couple's second child, Olivia, lives in London.", "AFR_1001": "This weekend's G20 finance ministers' meeting in Sydney will almost certainly rubber-stamp an OECD \"standard\" for universal automatic exchange of financial data between tax offices of all countries.The supposed justification is to catch out tax cheats.

The whole idea is flawed. Banks, stockbrokers and insurance companies will become spies on their customers, not just for local tax authorities, but potentially for any government in the world.One global bank operating in Australia is already forcing customers to permit the bank to disclose their information to any government authority in the world. Edward Snowden exposed illegal spying, but this will all be legal.No warrants will be required.

Companies are increasingly employing the technique to prepare for uncertain futures. As part of its consultancy offering, Deloitte has been thinking about future scenarios for a range of industries for many years, and provided in last week's submission a series of alternative futures for financial services.With David Murray wanting his final report to become \"a blueprint that people can come back to [to assess] what a quality financial system should look like\" - and with financial system inquiries only coming around every 20 years or so - scenario planning may help Murray structure his regulatory thinking and ensure the final report's longevity.Murray has already said that in 20 years' time, \"it will be the technological changes that will loom largest in the changing shape of the whole system\". However, Deloitte reckoned the interim report underestimated the pace of change.The Deloitte scenarios start with \"steady as she goes\", an unlikely status quo option where banks remain concentrated, there's more vertical integration, and technology brings change, but only incrementally. There's also \"Asian acceleration\", a future where a big Chinese bank takes over one of the big four, the ASX is listed in an Asian hub, and Australian banks expand faster in Asia. Another is \"Meltdown\", a future of global sovereign debt crises, government support of the economy and policies like ring-fencing.But given the pace of technological change across society, it's the \"Digital and retail revolution\" scenario that is perhaps the most thought-provoking for banks as they scramble to bed down customer relationships in the digital realm.Digital developmentUnder this vision of the future, Australia's core banking system is disintermediated as non-banks offer traditional banking products; customers transact with corporate stored-value cards or frequent flyer points; big data rules; peer-to-peer retail lending and insurance flourishes; financial processes completely automate; financial advice is provided by algorithms; and digital banks proliferate.Deloitte questions whether the policy options proposed by the financial system inquiry \"have the width of foresight to accommodate such scenarios\". But the market is already charging towards this vision.\"Digital and retail revolutions could reshape finance even more fundamentally, with all the key technology trends - online, social media, mobility, cloud, big data analytics - changing what finance is,\" said Deloitte. \"Regulators will have to be ready to adapt to changing circumstances, but the thinking on what a more digital financial system will look like can start now.\"But regulation is, of course, only part of the picture. The future financial system will be shaped just as much by market forces and disruptors.Macquarie Group analyst Mike Wiblin estimates $27 billion of big bank annual revenue is up for grabs by new technology players over the long term. SocietyOne, Australia's first peer-to-peer lender co-founded by Matt Symons, is growing its loan book and expanding into niche lending, as high-profile investors prowl. Chris Brycki's Stockspot is automatically matching clients with low-cost ETFs via algorithms. What these entrepreneurs are doing will be just as important to the future as what Murray recommends.With a task force chaired by Prime Minister Tony Abbott examining innovation policy preparing to report, and a Senate committee examining innovation policy for a report next year, consideration of how to foster a tech economy has reached the corridors of power.But for many years now, all banks have been forced to adapt to exponential rates of technological change, initially as an information revolution coincided with the globalisation of markets and more recently the rise of mobile, apps and social media. With global tech giants morphing into financial services players and customers now sitting in the driving seat, demanding slicker digital services and sophisticated engagement, banks' thinking on technology can be insightful.So what do the banks' second-round submissions released last week reveal about what they want from technology-related law and policy over the coming decades?Comprehensive strategyWestpac said technology issues would be \"best managed through a comprehensive strategy to ensure the financial system's regulatory framework supports technological innovation, while managing potential risks\". But the bank preferred this to be led by the market within existing regulations, rejecting the need for a new a central body to monitor and advise the government, as put forward as an option by the interim report.\"Market-based innovation, overseen by our existing financial system regulators, is preferable and would provide a more efficient outcome. The establishment of a central mechanism or body raises the risk that innovation could be unintentionally hindered through the creation of another regulatory and oversight layer.\"Yet Commonwealth Bank of Australia observed government \"has a critical role to play in fostering and encouraging the development of a thriving local technology community that can further enhance the growth of the financial services sector through technology innovation.\"Technology-based services are now so fundamental to the commercial and social wellbeing of Australians and Australian business, and the speed of change so relentless, that new structures within government in relation to the digital economy have become necessary.\"CBA suggested public policy and regulatory oversight should \"maximise the digital advantage available to the Australian economy while balancing the potential systemic and privacy risks; ensure consistent and equitable oversight of participants in key sectors such as banking; and encourage and facilitate the safe use of technology by consumers\".The banks' submissions also supported the principle of technology neutrality when it comes to designing legislative principles. \"Digital and mobile technologies and new applications will reshape the financial services industry,\" said ANZ Banking Group. \"Obstacles to developing new services and customers choice should be minimised as far as possible, consistent with a sound and well-regulated financial system. Regulation should not entrench existing products or distribution channels.\"The prudential regulator's chapter on technology spoke of technological neutrality in the context of cloud computing. The cloud would be \"treated in the same manner as other business processes\" and the development of any guidance the subject to consultation, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said.\"The same prudential concerns apply to cloud computing technology involving a third party as apply to any material outsourcing arrangement. Under this approach APRA seeks to ensure that a regulated institution adequately understands and manages the risks associated with outsourcing, given the nature of the solution and the benefits anticipated.\"Antiquated legislationThe banks emphasised the importance of government cleaning up antiquated legislation. CBA's submission called for a task force \"to immediately identify statutory technology anachronisms and prepare a draft amendment bill to address the consequences of rapid digital evolution\" and committed itself to participating.", "AFR_108": "Far be it from us to decry a nice bit of jargon. After all, we spend our days talking about carve-outs, by which we mean contractual exceptions, jockeys, known to the public as barristers, and nolles, which are not a brand of vermouth but an announcement that Her Majesty's prosecutors are abandoning a criminal chase.But at least we can, if pressed, explain exactly what these arcane expressions really mean. The many prophets of cloud computing should be so lucky.The cloud isn't a solution, a technology, a product, a service or an architecture. It isn't even really new. For 20 years, network diagrams have depicted company networks precisely and drawn a single outward line connecting to a puffy white cloud representing the internet and all that stuff out there. Cloud computing is computing that makes use of the internet and all that stuff out there to take care of some functions that have traditionally been handled internally. If that sounds vague, it is. So it's nonsensical to proclaim the wonders of \"the cloud\" as if it were something in particular.Two examples illustrate the point. A Melbourne journal extolled the cloud this week, reporting a string of online services being used by small business to manage projects, track staff time, prospect for new customers, distribute files and keep their books. All good stuff, if you don't mind your data being disjointed instead of integrated.These services are generally based overseas with almost all customer interaction web-based. Don't count on talking with a human, whether it's for help or to complain. Their offerings are highly standardised and so are the terms of their service contracts. Try asking Google for a customised Google Docs set-up or to negotiate over their service terms. Invariably, they specify that the operator accepts no liability if things foul up.The very same week, a colleague became convinced that the cloud could solve their firm's IT headaches by serving up their standard desktop from a data centre. The very same applications they currently use, installed locally, would be available over a fat internet pipe, installed in a server farm tended by a team of caring technicians. A service like that must be highly customised, the contract carefully negotiated and the provider must accept pain if they foul up. Compare this with Google Docs and you quickly realise that characterising them both as instances of the cloud at work isn't very useful.Indeed, obfuscating the true nature of a service arrangement by dubbing it a gift from the cloud can be a dangerous thing. Business types who feel they should nod sagely at the suggestion their infrastructure and budgeting can be simplified with a cloud solution may not be so calm if the same proposal is more bluntly described. Their software, servers and data would be entirely outsourced and utterly at the mercy of a third party, and a hopefully reliable internet connection. The upside may be high, but the potential for catastrophic failure can't be ignored.Operational risk aside, if the scope of the services to be included in the operator's fixed charges isn't articulated in fine detail, additional costs for out-of-scope services could blow projected cost savings out of the water. Any enterprise that gets involved in this kind of cloud computing without thorough due diligence, careful documentation and its eyes wide open is courting disappointment, or worse.Whatever the cloud may be, the problem for Australians is the uncompetitive cost of reliable high speed bandwidth. What enterprise wouldn't want the peace of mind of at least two big internet pipes, entering their building on different sides and taking entirely separate routes to the data centre? And throw in a wireless 3G option in case two backhoes cut the two optical cables on the same day.But most of us will have to be content with data connections that are far more affordable and settle for less assured reliability. This month, Microsoft releases its free online versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel, but nobody who has experienced the late afternoon internet slowdown that afflicts so many Australian CBD offices will dream of betting their business silverware on an online office suite hosted on another continent.By all means let's keep talking about the cloud if it's useful shorthand for the internet and all that stuff out there. But let's not fool ourselves or others that the cloud is some kind of specific science.When all is said and done, it's just jargon.peter.moon@privacy.com.au", "AFR_1019": "Game on The battle between Virgin and Qantas is proving a boon to customers.Eighteen months ago Virgin Australia chief executive John Borghetti told a financial results briefing that the airline was moving from a game-changer strategy to one of \"game on\". The dogfight between Virgin and Qantas, his former employer, for high-yield business travellers has heated up - and it's giving corporate Australia more than just cheaper air tickets.Demand is driven by more than price. Frequent travellers and procurement managers look at the quality of the product - airport lounges, inflight meals, seating standards and frequent flyer programs - and also weigh up scheduling and logistics issues when choosing a preferred domestic airline.On the upgraded services score, business flyers have never had it so good.Take the turf war between Qantas and Virgin on transcontinental routes. It has resulted in bigger aircraft - twin-aisle Airbus A330s - being dedicated to routes between the east coast and Perth that used to be flown by smaller Boeing 737s. International-standard seats, including angled lie-flat seats with personal entertainment systems, have been introduced by Virgin. Qantas is countering with a lie-flat business-class seat called Business Suite it hopes will leapfrog Virgin's product.Business Suite will be fitted to Qantas A330s and offered on domestic east-west routes as well as on flights to Asia. To be rolled out from November, the seats will be arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration so that each passenger has direct aisle access, with the seating staggered to provide privacy.The domestic travel market is a pivotal battleground. Most companies, government departments and organisations such as universities spend 80 per cent or more of their travel budgets within Australia. Many negotiate contracted rates directly with the domestic carriers, with some operating their own in-house travel agencies. Others hire an external Travel Management Company (TMC) to manage and benchmark travel spending.Fierce competitionThe chairman of the Association of Travel Management Companies, Craig Smith, says competition between Qantas and Virgin is intense.\"The main beneficiaries are the travellers, the buyers,\" he says. \"From a corporate viewpoint, the advice to the market is to continue to negotiate because there is added pressure from the airlines to retain market share and it's a very healthy environment to negotiate in.\"Gregory Lording, of FCm Travel Solutions, a TMC owned by Flight Centre, says the cost of domestic business class fares has dropped significantly since 2012, although the level of discounting in the market has levelled out over the past 12 months.\"The real benefit is coming with the on-board product,\" he says.\"Qantas has always served meals and free alcohol on Cityflyer flights after 4pm, and Virgin has now introduced meal service on longer-haul flights in Australia. They've all upgraded their lounge products, valet parking and on-board televisions - they've invested in the traveller experience.\"Lording says purchasing managers take these product and service considerations ito account. They want cost savings on the airfares, he says, but other things bundled ito the deal, too, such as complimentary or cut-price memberships to the lounges.Smith says in the current environment more corporations are focusing on making savings and some are avoiding travel altogether.\"A lot of organisations work on a July-June financial year and as we come ito the back end of this financial year we're seeing more freezes on travel,\" he says. \"Travel is one of those short-term cost avoiders you can implement with relatively little pain.\"Benefits of travelEven so, face-to-face meetings are a proven way to boost the bottom line. A global study by Oxford Economics has estimated that for every dollar invested in business travel, companies can expect $12.50 back in increased revenue and $3.80 in additional profits.Surveys of the Australian hotel market indicate city-centre room tariffs are on the rise, mainly because few new hotels are being built these days.But airfare indexes compiled by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) show business class fares fell substantially in late-2011 because of reductions Qantas made to many of these fares.The business-fare index again dropped significantly in early-2012 as Virgin morphed from a budget carrier ito a full-service airline and introduced business class on most of its routes. Although this index rose modestly through 2013, local business-class fares are still about 50 per cent cheaper than the going rates in June 2011.Many executives and public servants fly on domestic full economy fares. The bureau's index of movements in the price of these fares has been falling slightly since mid-2013, reflecting the ongoing competition.BITRE data shows corporate airfares have dropped most deeply in the domestic business-class cabin. The yields Virgin, Qantas and regional carrier, Rex, make on fare sales have also fallen, and all three have reported losses on their domestic operations.Best deals go to corporate sectorTony Webber, Qantas's chief economist between 2007 and 2011, who now heads Webber Quantitative Consulting and lectures at the University of Sydney business school, says all demand segments of the market are enjoying cheaper airfares.\"But I think the corporate segment is getting the best deals, because we know that John Borghetti is ... aggressively pursuing large and medium corporates for their business,\" Webber says.\"He is offering them strong incentives, and then the travel procurement sections of those big corporates are going to Qantas and saying, 'Can you match this?' Qantas invariably is, particularly for the big accounts.\"There are fewer road blocks today to stop organisations from switching allegiances. Virgin has business class; a 4 million-member frequent flyer program, Velocity; valet parking and premium lounges.Its latest lounge expansion, opened in Melbourne in March, doubles the facility's capacity to 604 seats. The lounge has a separate wine bar and a barista service that's expected to serve up 1500 coffees on weekday mornings.Added to this, Virgin has quietly introduced its version of the invitation-only Qantas Chairman's Lounge, where captains of industry rub shoulders with premiers and cabinet ministers.These uber-lounges, with entrances discretely located near the mainstream lounges, offer meeting rooms and service and amenity levels similar in standard to an international first-class lounge.", "AFR_1083": "Investing in technology needn't be like playing the lottery. Though some investors are prepared to take a risk on unknown quantities with dubious forecasts, Australia has a deep pool of IT companies with track records of profitability.After a few years of underinvestment and a federal budget free of surprises, now is a good time to consider your exposure to the companies that build and maintain vital infrastructure for modern businesses.Following a bout of indiscriminate selling, a small group of local players operating in the cloud, software and billing sectors appear ripe for a rebound.While in recent months companies have been flagging ordinary performances for 2013-14, investors who are able to look through to forecasts of 2014-15 may find the picture more agreeable.Consequently, bargain hunters would be well served to scour through what is definitely an oversold sector. Like every other industry it is cyclical, but in the case of IT stocks their rebound could be rapid and substantial. Historic cyclical trends suggest that after a lengthy period of underinvestment there is usually a sharp upturn in spending from businesses that need to upgrade hardware and software to stay competitive, control costs through improved systems management, and address issues of obsolescence.All of the following seven stocks selected by Smart Investor were profitable in 2012-13 and are forecast to deliver profits in the coming two years. In most cases earnings growth is substantial, particularly in 2014-15. For investors, the trick is to identify one with the brightest prospects or spread the risk with a basket of the best offerings.Hansen Technologies develops, implements and assists in maintaining a wide range of customer support and billing solutions for service providers in the energy, pay TV and telecommunications sectors. Its global client base extends to more than 40 countries providing ideal revenue diversification.Though the company has in part been a growth by acquisition story, it has also generated strong organic growth under a leadership team extremely focused on generating robust shareholder returns. Hansen Technologies has been profitable every year for the past 10 years and paid healthy dividends each year since 2008.The company's interim result featured profit growth of 89 per cent on the back of an increase in revenue of 54 per cent. Hansen has traditionally targeted high margin businesses, and first half earnings before interest and tax margins of 22 per cent indicate this is still the case.Hansen's fortunes received a significant boost in the last fortnight with the acquisition of US-based Ventyx, a utilities billing and customer care business.Ventyx services 30 states throughout the US, as well as Canada and the Caribbean. The acquisition complements Hansen's existing position in the gas and electricity markets, and its water billing business will provide additional diversification, cross selling and growth opportunities.The acquisition should also provide a substantial earnings boost with management indicating an additional 10 per cent in annual revenues. Consensus forecasts point to earnings-per-share growth of about 60 per cent in 2013-14, suggesting the company's price-earnings multiple of about 15 is conservative.Data 3 has gone from market darling to ugly duckling in the last 12 months with its shares falling from about $1.30 to hit a recent low of 54\u00c2\u00a2. This has been triggered by a deterioration in earnings in 2012-13, a poor first half result in 2013-14 and recent news that it was in for a tough second half.When the provider of IT products and services didn't offer definitive full-year guidance for 2013-14 the negative commentary was enough to prompt brokers to substantially downgrade forecasts. Analysts at Moelis slashed their profit forecasts from $9.8 million to $6.5 million, representing earnings per share of 4.2\u00c2\u00a2.This is definitely a stock where investors would be wise to look through to 2014-15 when brokers are tipping earnings per share growth of more than 20 per cent. While this won't see Data 3 back to its best, it is likely to signal a re-rating that sees the company trading close to historical forward multiples which would imply a share price of about 90\u00c2\u00a2 should the company meet its milestones in 2015.Importantly, Data 3 hasn't been losing market share with revenues from both its products and services divisions fairly static. The main issue has been margin erosion, a normal consequence when providers are vying for business in a demand-constrained environment.Business systems expert DWS has been hammered over the last six months, falling from about $1.50 to a recent five-year low of $1.03.As bad as that sounds, the company could be entering buy territory following a positive earnings update and a revised 12-month price target of $1.25 from analysts at Moelis.The broker is forecasting net profit to decline from $16.9 million in 2012-13 to $14.8 million in 2013-14. Earnings per share are tipped to fall 12.4 per cent to 11.1\u00c2\u00a2, significantly less than the 30 per cent decline in the company's share price.While DWS has delivered limited growth over the last five years, it has consistently paid strong dividends.Moelis is forecasting a full-year dividend of 10\u00c2\u00a2 in 2013-14, a yield of 8.5 per cent, only slightly below the 11\u00c2\u00a2 return paid in 2012-13.Finance and government account for more than half of the company's revenues, and management is expecting income from the latter to increase in the near term, driven by demand for the company's high-security facility it has established to cater for the needs of the Department of Defence.Though the Coalition government has been keen to cut costs at every opportunity, security was one of its key priorities leading to the election and it seems unlikely this will change.Integrated Research is a global provider of performance management diagnostic software and payment and communications systems. The company is best known as the creator of Prognosis, a performance management system used by the world's largest banks, airlines and telecommunications companies.Prognosis 10 was released in November 2013, providing a consolidated software platform allowing the company to bring new solutions to market and introducing new capabilities such as web interfacing and mobile access.Integrated Research generates income from the collection of licence and maintenance fees, as well as consulting. Licence fee revenue grew a strong 28 per cent in the first half to $13.8 million, representing just over half of group income; 95 per cent of sales are derived from international clients. Strong full-year growth is expected, with consensus forecasts indicating earnings per share will increase by 22.4 per cent to 6.6\u00c2\u00a2, implying a price-earnings multiple of about 16.As a company that has delivered ten consecutive years of profitability, consistent growth, and paid a dividend every year during that period, Integrated Research is arguably undervalued. Its shares have come off about 10 per cent since January despite positive news flow, suggesting that a move higher isn't too far off.Oakton's share price has held up reasonably well given the tough conditions, trading at the midpoint of its 12-month range, which has fluctuated between a low of $1.10 and a high of $1.85. However, its share price slumped from $1.46 at the start of May to a recent low of $1.23.Management confirmed in April the business was performing as previously guided, and it was fairly obvious the recent sell-off was triggered by negative sentiment towards IT stocks in the US. Consequently, this could represent an opportunity to buy into the stock on a relatively cheap multiple. The provider of IT services to the government and business sector is expected to deliver a flat 2013-14 result followed by 15.3 per cent growth in 2014-15. The company's recent trading range implies a price-earnings multiple of less than 12 relative to consensus forecasts for 2014-15.Most of Oakton's operating segments have remained resilient, but the company has experienced problems in the New South Wales and ACT markets mainly as a result of constrained spending and project delays, particularly in relation to the government sector.This is the area of the business that appears most at risk in the near term as the federal government strives to stem costs, and no doubt budget developments have exacerbated negative sentiment towards the stock.PS&amp;C listed on the ASX in December, and though the company has mainly traded at a discount to its IPO price of $1, it could be argued the sell-off that has occurred through most of 2014 had more to do with broader sector sentiment.Analysts at Bell Potter like the story, and their buy recommendation and share price target of $1.15 implies upside of more than 50 per cent. Forecasts are certainly supportive of a re-rating with the company trading on a price-earnings multiple of about 7.5 relative to the broker's 2013-14 forecasts.Projections indicate double-digit earnings per share growth in 2014-15 and 2015-16, so the company appears to be flying under the radar. Even if earnings came in a little on the low side of expectations this is fully captured in the heavily discounted share price.PS&amp;C has diversified industry exposure with leverage to resilient sectors such as education, finance and telecommunications. The company's Allcom business generates revenue from government and blue-chip clients such as Telstra. Through this area of its operations the company provides network infrastructure and consulting services, a relatively high-margin business.The S@P business has been in operation for 18 years, and the big names like Amcor, Schweppes and Fujitsu on its books speak for themselves. The company's security division also has an impressive client portfolio that includes major banks, TabCorp and Westfield.While this generated less revenue than the other two divisions, earnings before interest and tax margins were nearly 25 per cent, suggesting this could be an important part of the business.With IT security an increasingly important issue it isn't surprising to see signs that this area of its operations is set to grow. Management cited Privacy Act changes being enacted in March as likely to drive activity and re-evaluation of security issues. It is also important to note preferred supplier arrangements have been entered into recently with an overseas bank and two additional Australian financial institutions.A change of business model has been instrumental in not only returning Altium to profitability, but making it a real force. Altium's area of expertise is printed circuit boards and while this continues to be central to Altium's core business, a broad-based design and service product offering has provided it with a competitive edge.Analysts at Bell Potter recently initiated coverage of Altium with a buy recommendation and a 12-month price target of $2.75. The company's shares underwent a substantial re-rating in 2013 after management flagged a strong financial performance in July and followed up with a stellar result in August.This resulted in its share price more than doubling from $1.34 to a high of $2.90. Over the last six months it has mainly traded in the vicinity of $2.40, but recent negative sentiment towards the sector has seen it come off by about 15 per cent.With the company now trading at a discount of about 25 per cent to Bell Potter's price target it may be a good opportunity to buy into the stock. The broker is forecasting earnings-per-share growth of 26 per cent in 2014-15 and 29 per cent in 2015-16.", "AFR_1057": "Washington David Murray was surprised by how quickly technology is transforming the financial services industry in the United States.\"These young guys in Silicon Valley are into the lot,\" Mr Murray said in an interview in Washington last week.The technology landscape in the world's most innovative economy and biggest financial market poses two main issues for the financial system inquiry headed by Mr Murray.New technology providers, especially in the payments system, are disrupting traditional banking.\"It's really clear that technology is exercising the minds of the existing banking industry,\" Mr Murray said.Technology is infiltrating financial services in a myriad ways.The swift advancement of big data allows banks to tailor services and products based on individual behaviours. Artificial intelligence, in place of humans, conducts credit assessments to approve or decline loans.New payments providers such as Google and PayPal are transferring funds online, competing against the more highly regulated banking sector.Direct online platforms have empowered peer-to-peer lending.New exchange-traded fund products are popping up thanks to sophisticated electronic algorithms. Then there is high frequency trading.As an overarching principle, Mr Murray welcomes emerging technology injecting competition and productivity into financial services.\"New technology is the prerequisite for productivity improvement and at economics school it's the only free lunch,\" Mr Murray said.\"It's positive for efficiency, positive for competition and needs managing on the stability front.\" Stability is the second key issue the financial system inquiry is dealing with in the technology domain.Newfangled technology and wide ranging data could create systemic risks in the financial system, open up pathways for cyber criminals to ply their trade and threaten individual privacy rights.Mr Murray recognises that technology advancements pose regulatory dilemmas.The chair of the government's financial system inquiry seems to be leaning towards a \"flexible\" regulatory structure that will stand the test of time when unforeseen technologies emerge in the future.\"We are trying to weigh up how you have a regulatory structure that can adapt without having to stop and start every time there is a major shift,\" Mr Murray said.\"It causes us to raise the question, 'How do you get the benefit of the technology, design the regulatory architecture so that you can regulate if you have to, according the principles you've set up'.\"\"Or do you take a very firm stance, particularly on the payments system and maybe make it harder to get some of the benefits from the technology?\"The technology space has become a far more important consideration for this financial inquiry than the Stan Wallis review in 1997.At the time, only 14 per cent of households had access to the internet. Today, 83 per cent of households do.", "AFR_1034": "United States accounting software vendor, Intuit, has conceded what many long suspected - its super cheap $4.99 a month offer to gain a toehold in the Australian market cannot last beyond December. It will begin raising prices from January to bring them in line with MYOB, Xero, Reckon and the like.At the Accounting Technology Software Conference in Melbourne on Monday, Intuit Australia managing director Nicolette Maury said Australian consumers are not overpaying for cloud accounting software.\"When you look at the time accountants are saving [using cloud] the numbers are phenomenal,\" she said.\"Small businesses using cloud - particularly mobile offerings - are saving up to nine weeks a year in time.\"This flies in the face of claims by some that expense deters cloud adoption.There is a perception in the market that Intuit's strategy in Australia is a disruptive one, aimed at slowing innovator Xero's progress in the North American market.Australian market a drawcardMs Maury assured potential clients the Australian market was attractive to Intuit as part of building global growth.\"[Intuit's] not going away. We are investing heavily. It's very much a here-to-stay strategy,\" she said.Intuit has signed 7000 subscribers to its cloud accounting software since January. This compares with Xero, which has 158,000 users in Australia, MYOB with more than 100,000 and Reckon's 25,000.Intuit's domestic sales and support team has swollen from five to 50 in the past year.Product released to speed upIt will accelerate local product releases in the next three months, as well as its ecosystem partnerships.Intuit was due to unveil its latest version of QuickBooks Online Accountant in the US on Tuesday. It says the version's enhanced features will help accountants save time, grow their practice, and add value to their clients. It will be available in Australia early in 2015.While data security remains an inhibitor to growth, cloud accounting vendors feel the likelihood of a privacy breach is diminishing.\"Security concerns are no greater than when we started putting things on servers and started emailing,\" MYOB boss Tim Reed said.\"But they are different and we need to be having different conversations with clients, so we are prepared.\"", "AFR_1006": "Single people - old and young - are the fastest-growing household type. They want smaller homes with no backyard to maintain, to live close to work and take advantage of built-in services like gyms, pools and concierges.That's why people are increasingly choosing to make their homes in flats, studios, shop-top, townhouses or granny flats and turning away from the 20th century ideal of a quarter-acre block.In fact, only 41 per cent of Sydneysiders would choose to live in a detached house but 62 per cent of current homes in Sydney are traditional detached housing.There are lots of benefits to people living closer together in these types of homes, especially around transport.Better services close by mean that everyday activities like shopping, eating out, going to the doctor or picking up the kids from school or childcare can be done on foot, rather than having to drive some kilometres away. Less driving equals less pollution and more exercise - plus it's more convenient and takes cars off the road which is good for those who do need to drive.Higher-density communities cost us less as taxpayers and homeowners as well, with the cost of essential services like water, roads, public transport, electricity and telecommunications much less than in more spread out communities.They're cheaper to buy as well, helping first homeowners and lower income earners break into the market.Living more compactly frees up land for parks, plazas and other public spaces.Planners are getting smarter about how these places work and what they can offer - from unspoilt bushland in the heart of the city to kilometres of bike tracks, outdoor theatres to fun and stimulating children's playgrounds.For many older Sydneysiders moving to an apartment or townhouse allows them to stay in the neighbourhood they know and love without the burden of maintaining a large, older home that no longer suits their needs or lifestyle.This is really important as the number of older people in Sydney grows.This does not mean we should all move into apartments, or that Sydney will turn into Hong Kong or Manhattan.Rules were put in place to make sure that apartments are well-designed and suitable for the suburbs in which they are built.A decade on, these rules are being updated to reflect what we know we need from apartments now and into the future.We need to take what we loved from the homes of last century - open space for the family to enjoy - and make sure it's available for those who live in apartments, flats and townhouses too.Apartment living should not mean that quality is sacrificed - and that is what our changes ensure by setting minimum standards for communal open space, light, air and privacy.It's all part of planning for a growing NSW - ensuring home quality and choice to meet demand while helping to maintain important quality of life."}
