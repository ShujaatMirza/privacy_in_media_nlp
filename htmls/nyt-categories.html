/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Anti-piracy bills overshadow bid to ensure security in U.S.;Congress reluctant to act after online lobby stirred opposition to 2 measures</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1159</span>
FULL TEXTThe ghosts of two doomed U.S. anti- piracy bills hang over a new and unrelated issue in Washington: proposed <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">legislation</span> to help secure U.S. nuclear plants, water systems and other essential infrastructure from hackers and terrorists.In both houses of Congress, support is growing for proposed <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">legislation</span> that would authorize the U.S. government to regulate the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> of privately owned critical infrastructure, much of which is controlled by systems connected to the Internet and susceptible to hacking.For national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> reasons, the bills seek to give the U.S. government the ability to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> and analyze <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> from private companies about how they <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> themselves from attack. Those companies are skittish about government <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">regulation</span> generally. Civil liberties advocates, meanwhile, warn against excessive information-gathering by the government in the name of computer security.And members of Congress are wary of taking any steps that could infuriate the Internet industry, along with legions of newly politicized Web users, who won a surprise victory against two proposed anti-piracy <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> in the United States last month: the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, in the House of Representatives; and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA, in the Senate.Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California, who recently introduced a computer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> bill, acknowledged that Washington had learned some lessons about the new political muscle of technology companies and their users. &#39;&#39;One of the things we learned is that we have to raise the debate such that no one believes things are being done behind closed doors,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lungren said by telephone.A congressional aide, who did not want to be <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, put the lessons of the U.S. anti-piracy efforts more bluntly. Some members, the aide said, &#39;&#39;were kind of scarred by that experience and don&#39;t want to go down any road where they are viewed as regulating the Internet.&#39;&#39;In fact, the latest <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">network</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> bills being considered in Washington do not regulate the Internet, and it is not clear whether they will get much attention from the public.The Senate computer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> is expected to be introduced as early as Friday by Joseph I. Lieberman, Susan M. Collins and John D. Rockefeller IV. It would give the Department of Homeland Security regulatory authority over essential services companies if attacks on them could jeopardize human life or U.S. national security. It would compel critical infrastructure companies and government agencies to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about threats and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breaches</span> and would give the government power to impose sanctions on companies that ran afoul of the law.Details of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> are still being negotiated. A hearing on it is scheduled for next week.The House of Representatives version of the bill, which Mr. Lungren proposed in December and is expected to go before a full committee in coming weeks, would allow Homeland Security to lay out performance standards for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> but does not give it explicit powers to regulate.Kevin Richards, vice president for government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents large contractors of the U.S. government like Lockheed Martin, said members of the group were wary about being told what to do by the U.S. government. &#39;&#39;When it comes to the tech community and Capitol Hill, we look at two cardinal rules,&#39;&#39; Mr. Richards said. &#39;&#39;First is, &#39;Do no harm.&#39; Second is, &#39;Beware unintended consequences.&#39;&#39;&#39;The U.S. government, he suggested, would do better to focus on improving its own security. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s important for our community to remain flexible and nimble in how we respond to the evolving cyberthreat,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The government should lead by example, when it comes to securing its network.&#39;&#39;Neither the private sector nor government agencies have been immune to attacks in the United States. Large government contractors like Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton have suffered from embarrassing intrusions in the past year, as have RSA, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> division of EMC, and the F.B.I.Security researchers have repeatedly pointed to holes in the way industrial systems are protected, including those that handle power grids and oil rigs. The vulnerabilities are all the more worrisome, as more and more of these systems are connected to the Internet. Passwords can be weak. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> can be transmitted without encryption. Hackers can remotely turn machines on and off or tweak critical processes by adjusting valves.&#39;&#39;Failure to properly control or restrict <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to these elements can lead to catastrophic accidents,&#39;&#39; Paul Ferguson, a researcher with TrendMicro, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> firm, concluded recently in a blog post on his company&#39;s site.The best-known computer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">attack</span> on an industrial system used a computer worm called Stuxnet and appears to have been aimed at Iran&#39;s nuclear weapons program. Some evidence suggests that it was a joint project of the United States and Israel.James A. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization based in Washington, worried that lobbying would produce a watered-down <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> that would do little to deter attacks.&#39;&#39;The ideology of the market that dominates American politics, that government &#39;is the problem,&#39; puts us at a disadvantage, because it&#39;s certainly not true for defense,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lewis said. &#39;&#39;A weak <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> guarantees a hit.&#39;&#39;The administration of President Barack Obama has been nudging Congress to act on digital security, an issue that seems to garner rare bipartisan energy.James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, told a rare open hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that &#39;&#39;market incentives&#39;&#39; had kept both the private and public sector from being able to keep up with increasingly sophisticated online attackers. &#39;&#39;Cyberthreats pose a critical national and economic <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> concern,&#39;&#39; he said in testimony.One of the sticking points in any U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">legislation</span> is likely to be who can look at the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that private industry discloses about its own vulnerabilities and breaches. The intelligence community is eager to have <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to such information. Others are eager to keep it out of their reach.One civil liberties group in Washington warned that companies and their customers might become worked up if they discovered that intelligence agencies were trying to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">extract</span> as much <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> as possible in the name of security.&#39;&#39;I think there is a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> in moving too fast to authorize <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">sharing</span> of so much <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that it puts <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> at <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> and upsets a lot of the same people who spoke out&#39;&#39; against the anti-piracy legislation, said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the advocacy group Center for Democracy and Technology.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">On privacy, Europe and U.S. diverge;Slipstream</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1138</span>
FULL TEXTOver the years, the United States and Europe have taken different approaches to protecting people&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> information. Now the two sides are struggling to bridge the divide.In the United States, Congress has enacted a patchwork of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> that separately limit the use of certain sensitive records, like medical documents and credit reports. The European Union has instituted a common directive that gives its citizens certain fundamental rights - like the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to obtain copies of records held about them by companies and institutions - that are absent in the United States.Even so, U.S. officials maintain that the divergent approaches are equal. &#39;&#39;The sum of the parts of U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> protection is equal to or greater than the single whole of Europe,&#39;&#39; said Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel of the Department of Commerce in Washington. He is overseeing an agency effort to help develop codes of conduct for industry groups, like app developers, whose <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> and use of consumer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> are now unregulated.Europe begs to differ.&#39;&#39;Yes, we <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> the basic idea of privacy,&#39;&#39; said Peter Hustinx, the European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection supervisor. &#39;&#39;But there is a huge deficit on the U.S. side.&#39;&#39;And the data-control divide appears to be widening.A year ago, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive overhaul to strengthen online <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> rights - changes that could have big repercussions for U.S. technology companies and marketers that operate in the European Union. U.S. officials, trade groups and technology executives have responded by making frequent visits to Brussels and other cities, where they have urged regulators and legislators to reconsider the one-regulation-fits-all-data approach.What is at stake, U.S. industry representatives say, is nothing less than a free and commerce-friendly Internet.&#39;&#39;The ecosystem of the Internet is very delicate,&#39;&#39; said Kevin Richards, senior vice president for U.S. government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents companies like <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and Microsoft.&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not wise to have an overly broad, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach that would hinder or undermine the ability of companies to innovate in a global economy,&#39;&#39; he said.E.U. members already have <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> in place, based on a directive from 1995 that laid out principles for the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> information. The proposed new rules would strengthen some existing provisions, standardize <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protections across the 27 member states of the Union, and provide some new rights, like &#39;&#39;data portability&#39;&#39; - the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> of consumers to easily transfer their text files, photographs and videos from one <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> network, e-mail system or <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">storage</span> service to another. And they would subject companies that violate the rules to penalties of up to 2 percent of their annual global revenue.Asked for comment, Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the architect of the proposed regulation, said in a statement: &#39;&#39;The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update.&#39;&#39; She continued: &#39;&#39;That is why I have proposed a root-and-branch reform of the E.U.&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection rules - currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. - that will both <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> citizens&#39; rights and facilitate business in the digital age.&#39;&#39;But some provisions seem too rigid to U.S. officials and trade groups.They argue that the U.S. approach, which includes sector-specific <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws, in addition to industry self-regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, is more nimble.&#39;&#39;We hope that Europe will move in the direction of those multistakeholder standards, and not standards which are not flexible and don&#39;t move at Internet speed,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Kerry, who has traveled to Europe four times over the past year to discuss these issues.From the perspective of some European legislators, however, U.S. representatives appear more interested in protecting commerce than consumers.The U.S. effort may have backfired, they say, pushing some European officials toward even broader measures.Last month, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German representative in the European Parliament who reviewed the draft regulation, proposed additional rights for citizens - like the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> not to be subject to consumer profiling.&#39;&#39;My impression is that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Commerce Department are mostly just following the interests of Silicon Valley,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This leads to heavy pressure on the European regulator.&#39;&#39;But Mr. Kerry said the United States had to make its views known if the systems were to work in concert.&#39;&#39;I know that some people have raised eyebrows at our involvement; I make no apologies,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kerry said. &#39;&#39;We in the United States and countries and businesses around the world are stakeholders in this process. This has an important impact on the global economy.&#39;&#39;The solution to this trans-Atlantic clash may simply be U.S. ingenuity.Last year, President Barack Obama proposed a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> of rights for consumers that would give Americans many of the same baseline protections that the draft European rule proposes to reinforce. These include the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to records that companies hold about them, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to correct those records and the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to have limits on the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> that companies <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> and keep. Officials in Washington said they would work with Congress on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">legislation</span> protecting those rights and to extend oversight to industries not currently covered by U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws.A coalition of more than a dozen U.S. advocacy groups said it would send a letter on Monday to senior officials in the Obama administration seeking a meeting to ensure that U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> makers&#39; efforts in Europe &#39;&#39;are not averse to the views expressed by the president.&#39;&#39; The coalition includes the Electronic <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy.&#39;&#39;Does the Obama administration really want to be on the opposite side of the European effort to upgrade and modernize its <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> which is at its core about the protection of a fundamental freedom?&#39;&#39; asked Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> Information Center and a professor of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> at Georgetown University in Washington.European officials hold out hope that Congress will enact baseline consumer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> protections for Americans.&#39;&#39;This development - which is much welcomed in Europe - shows that we have much in common,&#39;&#39; Ms. Reding of the European Commission said in her statement, speaking of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> of rights. &#39;&#39;Convergence is springing up and synergies are possible.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 455</span>
FULL TEXTFacebook, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and Microsoft have asked the U.S. government for permission to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">reveal</span> details about the classified requests they receive for the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> of foreign users.They made the request Tuesday after revelations about the National Security Agency&#39;s secret Internet <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> program, known as Prism, for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> - like e-mail messages, photos, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> documents, videos and online chats - from technology companies. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> is legally authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which forbids companies from acknowledging the existence of requests or revealing any details about them.For the first time, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> publicly acknowledged that it had received FISA requests and said it had complied with far fewer of the requests than it received. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and Microsoft did not go as far as discussing requests they had received but, like Google, said they wanted to be able to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">publish</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> on the volume and scope of the government requests.Christopher Soghoian, a senior <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> analyst studying privacy, technology and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that while he appreciated the statements from the companies, they were largely meant to save face with users and employees.Many questions remain unanswered after the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">leak</span> of N.S.A. documents about Prism, including precisely how the technology companies and the government cooperate. Prism refers to an automated system for electronically exchanging <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> regarding FISA requests, according to people briefed on how it works. David Drummond, Google&#39;s chief legal officer, said in an interview on British television Tuesday that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> hands over the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to the government in person or by using a secure file-transferring method.But the companies say they are frustrated that they are unable, because of a government gag order, to give more details on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">sharing</span> of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">user</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> with the government.That gap in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> has fed speculation that is untrue, Mr. Drummond wrote in a letter Tuesday to Eric H. Holder Jr., the U.S. attorney general, and Robert S. Mueller, the director of the F.B.I. In the letter, Mr. Drummond asked for permission to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">publish</span> both the number of national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> requests, including FISA disclosures, that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> receives and their scope.Mr. Drummond was unavailable for an interview.In a statement, Leslie Miller, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> spokeswoman, said that &#39;&#39;only a tiny fraction&#39;&#39; of Google&#39;s hundreds of millions of users worldwide were subject to government <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> requests each year.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">GPS and the law</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 475</span>
FULL TEXTLast week brought fresh revelations about the National Security Agency&#39;s invasive <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of phone <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> on Americans and others, as reported first by The Washington Post. In another realm of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> - the government&#39;s broad use of location <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> devices - the Justice Department was in federal court on Thursday defending its refusal to release memos containing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about its policies governing the use of GPS and other potentially invasive technologies.The American Civil Liberties Union had brought the lawsuit to demand that the department make the memos public. The documents were prepared after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling, United States v. Jones, which held that placement of a hidden <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> device on a suspect&#39;s car constitutes a &#39;&#39;search&#39;&#39; under the Fourth Amendment.That case left lots of questions unanswered, including whether GPS <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> always requires a warrant based on probable cause, and how the Fourth Amendment applies to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> someone 24/7 with cellphone location technology. After the decision was released, the F.B.I.&#39;s general counsel, Andrew Weissmann, mentioned in a public talk that the government was issuing memos containing official guidance for federal agents and prosecutors on when they can use <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> technology and how the Jones decision applies to other types of techniques, beyond GPS.The public has a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to know government policies on these matters. There is very good reason to be concerned about the government&#39;s interpretation of its police powers, especially given the Obama administration&#39;s insensitivity to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> in its mass <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of phone <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> in the national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> sphere.When the A.C.L.U. filed a request for the memos under the Freedom of Information Act, the Justice Department responded by handing over copies with the text nearly entirely blanked out, prompting the lawsuit. The Justice Department claims that the memos were prepared anticipating litigation and are exempt from <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosure</span> because they are a lawyer&#39;s work product. But to the extent Mr. Weissmann accurately represented the memos, they also amount to statements of official policy, not merely exchanges by lawyers on legal theories.Our strong hunch is that there is material in the memos that can and should be revealed without <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">harm</span> to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement. At Thursday&#39;s hearing, Judge William Pauley III said he would personally review the documents before deciding whether they should be released.It is distressing that the administration, which claims to welcome a debate over the government&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> practices, time and again refuses to be transparent about those practices. Instead of awaiting a court order, the administration should release the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> memos on its own.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">U.K. squirms as questions pile up on surveillance;Government declines to confirm or deny a role in U.S. data program</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 886</span>
Stung by allegations that it colluded with American intelligence agencies to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> on its citizens, Britain&#39;s government insisted Monday that its secret services operate within the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> but did not give details of what rules apply to some requests for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> from foreign powers.Despite the growing public outcry over the issue, the British government has yet to confirm or deny reports that it had been given <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> from an American <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> program called Prism, which is said to have <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> Internet <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> on foreigners abroad from companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype.But in a statement to Parliament the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, rejected as &#39;&#39;baseless&#39;&#39; suggestion that the intelligence-gathering facility, Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ, had used its partnership with the United States to secure <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> not legally available to it at home.Britain, he added, had &#39;&#39;one of the strongest systems of checks and balances and democratic accountability for secret intelligence anywhere in the world.&#39;&#39;To <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">intercept</span> the content of any individual&#39;s communications in the U.K. requires a warrant signed personally by me, the home secretary or another secretary of state,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This is no casual process.&#39;&#39;However, according to reports, the Prism program gathers metadata - <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about patterns and locations of communications - rather than content.Asked by Douglas Alexander, spokesman for foreign affairs from the opposition Labour Party, what controls apply over requests from GCHQ for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> based on searches of foreign <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">databases</span> - rather than intercepts - Mr. Hague did not give a specific response.&#39;&#39;Because circumstances vary and because procedures vary according to the situation, I don&#39;t want to give a categoric answer,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hague told British lawmakers, though he added that &#39;&#39;ministerial oversight, independent scrutiny is there.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;The idea that operations are carried without ministerial oversight, somehow getting around U.K. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> is a mistaken idea,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hague added.Last week, The Guardian newspaper reported that GCHQ, generated 197 intelligence reports through the system in the year to May 2012. GCHQ has refused to comment on the details of the claims but said in a statement that its work &#39;&#39;is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">framework</span> which ensures that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.&#39;&#39;According to experts the legal situation remains opaque. &#39;&#39;We are told this is lawful but the precise nature of these legal judgements are hidden from us,&#39;&#39; said Richard Aldrich professor of international <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> at the University of Warwick who argued that intelligence agencies now had <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to enormous stores of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that could be cross-checked with other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> to build up a profile of individuals&#39; lives.&#39;&#39;The last 10 years has been about working out how to warehouse unbelievable amounts of boring <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> and how to analyze that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> - and they have cracked it,&#39;&#39; Mr. Aldrich said. Through such a process it would be possible for the authorities &#39;&#39;to have a better memory of what I was doing 10 months ago than I have,&#39;&#39; he added.Politicians in continental Europe have expressed concerns. &#39;&#39;All our e-mails and other electronic communication, including <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> media, even if sent only between European Union citizens, can be intercepted and read by U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> services,&#39;&#39; said Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the center political grouping in the European Parliament and a former prime minister of Belgium. &#39;&#39;This has obvious and very serious <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> consequences for E.U. citizens.&#39;&#39;Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron spoke in defense of the British intelligence agencies, also insisting they were operating within the law.&#39;&#39;I see every day the vital work they do to keep us safe,&#39;&#39; he said while answering questions after a speech in Essex, &#39;&#39;but it is vital work that is done under a legal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">framework</span> within the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> and subject to proper scrutiny by the intelligence and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> committee.&#39;&#39;The intelligence services operate within the law, within the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> that we have laid down, and they are also subject to proper scrutiny by the intelligence and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> committee of the House of Commons,&#39;&#39; he said.Though he added that he was satisfied that British agencies operate in a proper way, Mr. Cameron also said that the government could not give a &#39;&#39;running commentary&#39;&#39; on intelligence issues.In Parliament, Labour&#39;s spokesman, Mr. Alexander, praised the work of the intelligence services but called for reassurances &#39;&#39;in recognition of the depth of public concern that has arisen in recent days.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Our intelligence agencies&#39; work would be more difficult if levels of concern about the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">framework</span> under which they operate were to compromise the existing active support of the public for their efforts,&#39;&#39; Mr . Alexander added.Several lawmakers challenged Mr. Hague, some demanding assurances that their communications - or those of campaigners - were not being monitored. Mr. Hague cited an agreement dating from 1966 when the prime minister of the day gave an undertaking there would be no tapping of lawmakers&#39; phones - a promise later extended to include other forms of communication.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Online researchers grapple with ethics;Analyzing personal data without consent triggers calls for firm guidelines</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1302</span>
FULL TEXTScholars are exhilarated by the prospect of tapping into the vast troves of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> by Facebook, Google, Amazon and a host of start-ups, which they say could transform <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> science research.Once forced to conduct painstaking <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> interviews with subjects, scientists can now sit at a screen and instantly play with the digital experiences of millions of Internet users. It is the frontier of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> science - experiments on people who may never even know they are subjects of study, let alone explicitly consent.&#39;&#39;This is a new era,&#39;&#39; said Jeffrey T. Hancock, a Cornell University professor of communication and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> science. &#39;&#39;I liken it a little bit to when chemistry got the microscope.&#39;&#39;But the new era has brought some controversy with it. Professor Hancock was a co-author of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> study in which the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">network</span> quietly manipulated the news feeds of nearly 700,000 people to learn how the changes affected their emotions. When the research was published in June, the outrage was immediate.Now Professor Hancock and other university and corporate researchers are grappling with how to create ethical guidelines for this kind of research. In his first interview since the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> study was made public, Professor Hancock said he would help develop such guidelines by leading a series of discussions among academics, corporate researchers and United States government agencies like the National Science Foundation. &#39;&#39;As part of moving forward on this, we&#39;ve got to engage,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This is a giant societal conversation that needs to take place.&#39;&#39;Scholars from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford are planning panels and conferences on the topic, and several academic journals are working on special issues devoted to ethics. Microsoft Research, a quasi-independent arm of the software company, is a prominent voice in the conversation. It hosted a panel last month on the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> research with Professor Hancock and is offering a software tool to scholars to help them quickly survey consumers about the ethics of a project in its early stages.Although the United States Federal Trade Commission, which regulates companies on issues like <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and fair treatment of Internet users, declined to comment specifically on the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> study, the broader issues touch on principles important to the agency&#39;s chairwoman, Edith Ramirez.&#39;&#39;Consumers should be in the driver&#39;s seat when it comes to their data,&#39;&#39; Ms. Ramirez said in an interview. &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t want to be left in the dark and they don&#39;t want to be surprised at how it&#39;s used.&#39;&#39;Facebook, which has apologized for its experiment, declined to comment further, except to say, &#39;&#39;We&#39;re talking with academics and industry about how to improve our research process.&#39;&#39;Much of the research done by the Internet companies is in-house and aimed at product adjustments, like whether people prefer news articles or cat videos in their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> feeds or how to make Google&#39;s search results more accurate. But bigger <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> questions are studied as well, often in partnership with academic institutions, and scientists are eager to conduct even more ambitious research.The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> emotion experiment was in that vein. The brainchild of a company <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> scientist, Adam D.I. Kramer, but shaped and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">analyzed</span> with help from Professor Hancock and another academic researcher, Jamie E. Guillory, it was intended to shed light on how emotions spread through large populations. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> deliberately changed the number of positive and negative posts in the subjects&#39; news feeds over a week in January 2012, then looked at how the changes affected the emotional tone of the users&#39; subsequent <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> posts.In another well-known experiment, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> sent voting reminders to 61 million American users on Election Day in 2010. Some users also saw a list of their friends who said they had already voted, and the researchers found that the specific <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> nudge prompted more of those people to go to the polls. The study prompted some to suggest that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> had the power to sway election results.More recently, the dating site OkCupid conducted experiments on its users, including one in which it hid profile text to see how it affected personality ratings and another in which it told some daters they were a better or worse potential match with someone than the company&#39;s software actually determined.Such testing raises fundamental questions. What types of experiments are so <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">intrusive</span> that they need prior <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">consent</span> or prompt <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosure</span> after the fact?How do companies make sure that customers have a clear understanding of how their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> might be used? Who even decides what the rules should be?Existing United States government rules governing research on human subjects, intended for medical research, generally require <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">consent</span> from those studied unless the potential for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">harm</span> is minimal. But many <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> science scholars say the federal rules never contemplated large-scale research on Internet users and provide inadequate guidance for it.For Internet projects conducted by university researchers, institutional review boards can be helpful in vetting projects. However, corporate researchers like those at <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> don&#39;t face such formal reviews.Sinan Aral, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#39;s Sloan School of Management who has conducted large-scale <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> experiments with several tech companies, said any new rules must be carefully formulated. &#39;&#39;We need to understand how to think about these rules without chilling the research that has the promise of moving us miles and miles ahead of where we are today in understanding human populations,&#39;&#39; he said. Professor Aral is planning a panel discussion on ethics at a M.I.T. conference on digital experimentation in October. (The professor also does some <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> analysis for The New York Times Company.)Mary L. Gray, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research and associate professor at Indiana University&#39;s Media School, who has worked extensively on ethics in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> science, said that too often, researchers conducting digital experiments work in isolation with little outside guidance.She and others at Microsoft Research spent the last two years setting up an ethics advisory committee and training program for researchers in the company&#39;s labs who are working with human subjects. She is now working with Professor Hancock to bring such thinking to the broader research world.&#39;&#39;If everyone knew the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> thing to do, we would never have anyone hurt,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We really don&#39;t have a place where we can have these conversations.&#39;&#39;Dr. Gray advocates a simple litmus test for researchers: If you&#39;re afraid to ask your subjects for their permission to conduct the research, there&#39;s probably a deeper ethical issue that must be considered.For Professor Hancock, solutions could include an opt-in process for projects that involve big changes in an Internet user&#39;s experience, and a debriefing system to inform users about smaller tests after the fact.Companies will not willingly participate in anything that limits their ability to innovate quickly, he said, so any process has to be &#39;&#39;effective, lightweight, quick and accountable.&#39;&#39;While some would say the risks of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> study were obvious, Professor Hancock said the researchers did not realize that manipulating the news feed, even modestly, would make some people feel violated.He learned otherwise from hundreds of anguished and angry emails he received after the work was published. &#39;&#39;They said: &#39;You can&#39;t mess with my emotions. It&#39;s like messing with me. It&#39;s mind control.&#39;&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Pitfalls in haphazard spread of school apps;Powerful teaching tools welcomed, but privacy is among possible losses</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1262</span>
FULL TEXTAt school districts across the United States, the chief technology officers responsible for safeguarding student <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> are tearing their hair out.Scores of education technology start-ups, their pockets full from a rush of venture capital, are marketing new digital <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> tools directly to teachers. Many are even offering them free to get a foothold in schools. That has enabled educators nationwide to experiment with a host of novel &#39;&#39;adaptive learning&#39;&#39; products, like math and foreign language apps that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">record</span> and analyze students&#39; online activities to personalize their lessons.But the new digital tools have also left school district technology directors scrambling to keep <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">track</span> of which companies are <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> students&#39; <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> and how they are using it.&#39;&#39;A teacher can sign up for anything, without the knowledge of anyone else in the district,&#39;&#39; said Steve Young, the chief technology officer of the Judson Independent School District, a school system with some 23,500 students in San Antonio.Already, some districts have experienced <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breaches</span> with software they purchased from vendors; in a few cases, student records have been publicly posted on the Internet. And online <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> researchers have discovered weaknesses in a couple of dozen popular digital <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> services.Some legal scholars contend that the practice of signing up teachers directly, rather than their school districts, skirts federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws. Administrators like Mr. Young say they want teachers to have free <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to the best <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> apps. Yet guarding against the potential pitfalls - <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> breaches, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> theft, unauthorized student profiling - is a herculean endeavor.&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a huge challenge for big districts,&#39;&#39; Mr. Young said, &#39;&#39;and an even bigger challenge for smaller districts.&#39;&#39;These concerns are likely to widen as education technology proliferates. Last year, the market for educational software aimed at prekindergarten through 12th-grade students amounted to nearly $8.4 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2010, according to the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group.Yet, for now at least, each school district, of which there are more than 14,000 in the United States, is confronting these challenges and devising solutions on its own.In the Fairfax County, Va., school district, technology experts have conducted their own <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> reviews of several hundred digital <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> products, and failed a few of the most popular ones. In Houston, one of the largest districts in the country, administrators are testing their own rating system for digital <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> products and developing a set of district-approved apps for teachers.And in Raytown, Mo., Melissa Tebbenkamp, the school district&#39;s director of instructional technology, vets every app that teachers want to try before allowing it to be used with students. Among other things, she checks to make sure those services do not exploit students&#39; email addresses to push products on them or <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> students&#39; details with third parties.&#39;&#39;We have a problem with sites targeting our teachers and not being responsible with our data,&#39;&#39; Ms. Tebbenkamp said. For school technology directors around the country, she added, &#39;&#39;it is a can of worms.&#39;&#39;The new tools are being pushed by a rapidly expanding education technology industry. Some educators, entrepreneurs and philanthropists are particularly enthusiastic about adaptive <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> products because they aim to tailor lessons to the individual abilities of each student.&#39;&#39;If Suzy is good at long division but has trouble with division by zero, the software will show her more problems about division by zero,&#39;&#39; said Umang Gupta, an entrepreneur who has invested in Front Row Education, an adaptive math start-up, and other educational technology ventures.To get such products into classrooms quickly, many start-ups offer their basic products free to individual teachers but charge for extra features or districtwide use - a &#39;&#39;freemium&#39;&#39; business model.&#39;&#39;This is an industry driven by the freemium model, and that&#39;s a good thing,&#39;&#39; said Betsy Corcoran, the chief executive of EdSurge, an industry news service and research firm. &#39;&#39;It is giving teachers more of a voice in the tools that they use.&#39;&#39;The model makes it easy for teachers to try new products, but it also troubles many school technology directors. By enticing teachers to adopt nascent technologies on their own, they say, companies can bypass established district procedures for reviewing the effectiveness and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> of educational software.Teachers, these experts say, are typically not equipped to vet the data-handling practices of free educational apps that may <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> details as diverse as students&#39; names, birth dates, profile photos, voice recordings, homework assignments, quiz scores or grades.&#39;&#39;When it comes to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and security, it&#39;s a little unfair to put the burden on the teacher,&#39;&#39; said Bob Moore, a former school district technology director who now runs his own educational technology consulting firm. Teachers, he added, may also not know whether the apps have been rigorously studied to establish their effectiveness.&#39;&#39;If you have a math app that focuses on dividing and multiplying fractions,&#39;&#39; Mr. Moore said, &#39;&#39;you should have some evidence that shows how it actually improves student <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> around that particular objective.&#39;&#39;In addition, some education <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> scholars say that the direct-to-teacher marketing model circumvents federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws.One federal law, the Family Educational Rights and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> Act, requires school districts to maintain the confidentiality of student records and to keep control of those records, even if administrators outsource certain school functions to vendors.Another federal law, the Children&#39;s Online <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> Protection Act, allows schools to act in place of parents in allowing online providers to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> details from children. But the Federal Trade Commission recommends that schools not delegate that decision to individual teachers.&#39;&#39;Companies are soliciting teachers to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breach</span> the obligations of schools,&#39;&#39; said Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan.To help school administrators evaluate digital education services, the Department of Education recently issued best-practice recommendations for contracts. Last year, the Consortium for School Networking, an association for district technology professionals, introduced a free tool kit with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> questions for schools to ask their online service providers. And on Tuesday, a coalition of several dozen educational groups issued a set of principles for responsible use of student data.But Lenny J. Schad, the chief technology <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> officer of the Houston Independent School District, said that teachers were using so many different apps, sometimes trying them for no more than a week or even a day, that it was impractical, if not impossible, for districts to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">track</span> their use.&#39;&#39;The teachers have the ability to reach out on a much bigger scale than anything that we could manage,&#39;&#39; Mr. Schad said.Mr. Moore, the education technology consultant, said district officials and technology companies might eventually need to develop national standards for the classroom adoption of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> apps.&#39;&#39;There needs to be a better system,&#39;&#39; Mr. Moore said, &#39;&#39;than each school district doing their own vetting.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Police test cameras, but it&#39;s not clear who can watch</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1182</span>
FULL TEXTPolice departments around the United States have been moving with unusual speed to equip officers with body cameras to film their often edgy encounters with the public. But the adoption of these cameras has created a new conflict over who has the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to view the recordings.In Seattle, where a dozen officers started wearing body cameras in a pilot program in December, the department has set up its own YouTube channel, broadcasting a stream of blurred images to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> of people filmed. Much of this footage is uncontroversial; one scene shows a woman jogging past a group of people and an officer watching her, then having a muted conversation with people whose faces have been obscured.&#39;&#39;We were talking about the video and what to do with it, and someone said, &#39;What do people do with police videos?&#39;&#39;&#39; said Mike Wagers, chief operating officer of the Seattle police. His answer: &#39;&#39;They put it on YouTube.&#39;&#39;But YouTube video from other police body cameras can be violent and disturbing. Scenes unfold slowly, in cinéma vérité style, as officers go about their work until a moment arrives when someone is suddenly shot and killed. Sometimes words are exchanged before the shootings, but often they occur in silence. The footage has little in common with the stylized deaths in Hollywood movies: There is often no sign of bleeding, and bodies lie twisted as if they have been broken.In Bremerton, Wash., the police chief, Steven Strachan, is wary about making such footage public. After testing body cameras last year, he decided not to buy them for his 71 officers because he feared that the state&#39;s public records <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> would require him to turn over the film. Requests for footage, he said, would create an unwieldy administrative burden for his small department and could potentially violate privacy.&#39;&#39;We hit the pause button,&#39;&#39; Chief Strachan said. &#39;&#39;Our view is we don&#39;t want to be part of violating people&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> for commercial or voyeuristic reasons. Everyone&#39;s worst day is now going to be put on YouTube for eternity.&#39;&#39;Since the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager who was shot and killed by an officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August, police departments have begun requiring officers to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">record</span> their interactions with the public to hold them accountable for their behavior, as well as to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> them against false charges.Most big city American police departments - including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia - are still testing body cameras, and it could be at least a year before a significant number of officers in those cities are wearing them. But the battle over who has the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to see the video is well underway.At public forums, including in Los Angeles, advocates for the cameras have pressed the police to make the footage public. They pointed to police killings of unarmed black men and boys that did not lead to criminal charges, saying recordings could provide a fuller view of events than police accounts or even witness testimony.Several killings have been captured by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> cameras or by bystanders with cellphones, like the death of Walter L. Scott, who was shot several times in the back by a police officer in North Charleston, S.C., this month.&#39;&#39;If the public doesn&#39;t have the opportunity to view the video on their own, they are left with the police version of what happened, and as we&#39;ve seen recently, their version isn&#39;t always what happened,&#39;&#39; said Laniece Williams, the spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Coalition for Racial, Economic and Legal Justice. &#39;&#39;Even in cases where there isn&#39;t a fatal shooting, there are instances where police brutalize people, and the public should be able to see the video.&#39;&#39;But some state <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> makers are coming out against broad <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosure</span> policies. Among a flurry of 87 bills related to body cameras that have been introduced in 29 legislatures, 15 states are moving to limit what the public is allowed to see of the recordings. In some cases, lawmakers have sought to remove the videos from public records laws, according to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from the National Conference of State Legislatures.&#39;&#39;The issue challenges the assumption that everything that happens in public should be public,&#39;&#39; said James McMahan, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> director for the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. &#39;&#39;But I don&#39;t know that we want a woman standing there with bruises and scratches and other signs of domestic violence to be posted on YouTube. The instance of her being posted online forever might be a greater crisis than the original incident.&#39;&#39;In Philadelphia, where officers have fired at suspects at a rate of nearly once a week in the past eight years and where the city has paid out millions of dollars to victims of police brutality, residents have strongly called for officers to be equipped with body cameras.Activists like Ms. Williams of the justice coalition said they feared that much of the video will never be seen publicly. They point to the department&#39;s refusal to release <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> camera footage of the death of Brandon Tate-Brown, 26, who was shot by the police in December after being stopped for driving with his headlights off.The Philadelphia police said that they had shown the video to Mr. Tate-Brown&#39;s family and that the department had not yet devised a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> on the release of video from body cameras.Some of the most intense discussion of the issue is taking place in Washington State, where the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> allows anyone to file a public records request to obtain body camera recordings. In Bremerton, where Chief Strachan tested body cameras before deciding not to purchase them, the chief said the demands the department had received for video during the testing period had been too burdensome. &#39;&#39;We got a request for any and all video shot by a police officer,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s pretty much impossible.&#39;&#39;In nearby King County, Sheriff John Urquhart said he would not equip his deputies with cameras until lawmakers reworked <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosure</span> rules. &#39;&#39;I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;but if the public wants body cameras, they&#39;re going to have to give something up on public disclosure.&#39;&#39;Legislation being considered in the State House of Representatives would generally limit <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to the recordings to civilians directly involved in the encounter. Representative Drew Hansen, who introduced the bill, said there had been public records requests for &#39;&#39;anything interesting,&#39;&#39; including barroom fights.But Mr. Wagers, the chief operating officer of the Seattle police, said he understood that the proliferation of body cameras had whetted the public&#39;s appetite for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to the footage. The department, he said, is testing 12 body cameras but plans to outfit 900 patrol officers in 2016. He said the ultimate goal was to post online every moment of officers&#39; body camera recordings.&#39;&#39;What&#39;s the purpose of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> the data?&#39;&#39; he asked. &#39;&#39;To move to accountability and get to the truth.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 603</span>
FULL TEXTIs the digital revolution in the classroom giving the education technology industry carte blanche to exploit student data?That was the question some teacher and parents groups have posed in their public responses to the news last week that Pearson, the education publisher, had been covertly monitoring <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> sites to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> students who might have <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosed</span> questions from its assessment tests.In an effort to ease parent and teacher concerns, two congressmen are planning to introduce a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> on Monday that would place limits on how education technology companies can use <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about kindergarten through 12th-grade students.Called the Student Digital <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> and Parental Rights Act, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> would prohibit companies that operate school services - like online homework portals, digital grade books for teachers or student email programs - from knowingly using or disclosing students&#39; <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to tailor advertisements to them. It would also bar them from <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> or using student <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> to create marketing profiles.In phone interviews, Representative Jared S. Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, the bill&#39;s sponsors, said they hoped to increase trust in education technology companies.&#39;&#39;This is a first step in providing a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">framework</span> that can address the concerns of parents and educators and, at the same time, allow the promise of education technology to transform our schools,&#39;&#39; Mr. Polis said.But the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> is likely to be opposed by education <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> advocates who seek stronger <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">consent</span> mechanisms for students and parents - as well as by industry groups that favor self-regulation.&#39;&#39;All this <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bill</span> does is add additional legal hurdles for innovating educational services,&#39;&#39; an executive at a technology trade group wrote to associates on Friday in a private email that was forwarded to a reporter with the stipulation that the writer of the email not be identified.As school districts across the country turn to powerful new digital education tools, efforts to increase teacher and parent buy-in have been multiplying. Industry executives say that so-called adaptive <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> products seem particularly promising. These are apps and sites that can <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> and analyze a wealth of student <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> with the idea of tailoring lessons on the spot to the abilities of each child.&#39;&#39;The world of big <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> has hit the classroom,&#39;&#39; Mr. Messer said. &#39;&#39;We want to preserve the positive benefits the technology can bring to student outcomes.&#39;&#39;Some parents have started warning, however, that school districts lack the resources to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">monitor</span> how technology vendors use and secure their children&#39;s records.These parents say they&#39;re troubled by the risks as varied as <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breaches</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">theft</span> to the possibility of companies <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">sharing</span> sensitive details like students&#39; grades, disciplinary actions or health <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> with college or job recruiters.Although there is a federal education <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> that requires schools to maintain control over students&#39; educational records, critics say it has not kept pace with the practices of educational technology companies.&#39;&#39;As a parent, I&#39;m concerned that there are vast amounts of academic, physical and behavioral <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> being acquired on children that could have negative implications for our children&#39;s future,&#39;&#39; said Anna Shah-Bomba, a mother of an elementary school student and a college student in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">U.S. moves to adopt rules on drone use;Mandatory registration for recreational use is among list of proposals</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 951</span>
FULL TEXTDrones, those remote-controlled flying machines, are expected to top many wish lists this holiday season.Now those who open those gifts will most likely need to tell the federal government.On Monday, the United States Federal Aviation Administration, scurrying to prepare for hundreds of thousands of more drones flying into the air, released a list of recommendations for how to better <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">monitor</span> recreational use of the machines in the United States. Under the proposal, most drone owners would have to register the machines with the federal government, which would place the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> in a national database, the first such requirements.The recommendations, from a task force created by the agency, would be the biggest step yet by the government to deal with the proliferation of recreational drones, which are usually used for harmless purposes but have also been tools for mischief and serious wrongdoing, and pose a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> to airborne jets.The F.A.A. is widely expected to approve the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">bulk</span> of the recommendations in the next month, just in time for Christmas.The government already has rules that limit the use of drones for commercial purposes, like delivering packages. But attention has turned to recreational use more recently, as drones, many of them the size of a laptop computer, have emerged as a must-have item for thousands of people. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, has estimated that 400,000 drones will be sold this holiday season in the United States.&#39;&#39;The F.A.A. needs to meet growing political pressure that they do something before an incident that nobody wants to happen, happens,&#39;&#39; said Anne Swanson, a lawyer at Cooley, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> firm in Washington.Though drones have existed for years, their popularity has soared of late with improvements in technology and greater interest in photography and filmmaking from the sky. The broader adoption has also raised new questions about privacy, safety and the nuisance of small machines buzzing overhead.In the last two years, hundreds of complaints have been filed with the F.A.A. on drones striking bystanders at sports stadiums or flying too close to aircraft. Last May, an amateur drone pilot was arrested after flying his <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">machine</span> close to the White House.In addition to entering the machines into a national database, the task force said, drone owners should display a government-issued registration number on each machine. The group also recommended that owners submit their names and addresses, but said email addresses and phone numbers should be optional. The rules would apply to recreational drones weighing half a pound to 55 pounds.The F.A.A. would enforce registration rules and oversee the database. The task force recommended that the F.A.A. carve out separate registration-related penalties for drones. Registration violations applying to any aircraft can now exceed $25,000. That amount was established to deter suspected drug traffickers and tax evaders but should not apply to users of small recreational drones, the groups said.&#39;&#39;The task force recommends the F.A.A. expressly establish a reasonable and proportionate penalty schedule that is distinct from those relating to traditional manned aviation,&#39;&#39; the group said in its report.The task force did not go as far with its recommendations as some aviation and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> experts had hoped. The proposals say owners should not have to submit any <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about their aircraft, for example. It also said there should not be a requirement for drone users to be citizens or permanent residents.&#39;&#39;The F.A.A. is under tremendous pressure to do something because there is a lot of public concern around drones,&#39;&#39; said Loretta Alkalay, an aviation lawyer and professor at the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens, N.Y. &#39;&#39;But I don&#39;t think registration solves the main concerns.&#39;&#39;She added, &#39;&#39;We shouldn&#39;t really expect that the people with most nefarious intents would register in the database.&#39;&#39;Those complaints highlighted how difficult it has been for regulators to create guidelines for the flying machines. There is passionate disagreement by hobbyists, drone makers, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and safety advocates and the aviation industry on how much oversight the government should have and what kinds of machines should be included.The F.A.A. task force was composed of 25 people, including representatives of drone makers, technology companies, an airline pilots association and government officials. The agency gave them a short time - four weeks - to come up with recommendations on a registration system. The F.A.A. said it would take the recommendations into consideration and then write new rules.Members of the task force stressed that many compromises were made. The task force wrote in its report that the goal of the registration process was to &#39;&#39;ensure accountability by creating a traceable link between aircraft and owner, and to encourage the maximum levels of regulatory compliance by making the registration process as simple as possible.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;We tried to write it in as generic a flavor as possible,&#39;&#39; Dave Vos, a member of the task force and the head of a drone project at <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> X, a business that works on future technologies, said in a conference call.But <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> groups say simply registering names and addresses will not curb the ability of the machines to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">snoop</span> on people from above.The Electronic <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> Information Center, an advocacy group, has pushed for the F.A.A. to require that drones broadcast registration <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> and that the authorities be notified about their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> capabilities.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Don&#39;t limit speech in France</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 856</span>
FULL TEXTOn Tuesday, the French police arrested the controversial French comedian Dieudonné M&#39;bala M&#39;bala. He had written on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> &#39;&#39;I feel like Charlie Coulibaly&#39;&#39; - a mashup of Charlie Hebdo and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jewish hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris, in an <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">attack</span> linked to the Charlie Hebdo killers. Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala, the police say, is being investigated for &#39;&#39;defending terrorism.&#39;&#39;This is not the first time that he has been targeted by the authorities. Last year, the courts banned his stage show, and he has been convicted several times for anti-Semitic hate speech. But for his supporters, many of whom live on the outskirts of French cities in the banlieues that are home to much of France&#39;s North African population, the attempts to silence Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala exemplify the double standards of French society. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> of a satirical magazine to mock Islam is held sacred, they argue, yet Muslims are forbidden to express views that others may consider offensive.The cases of Charlie Hebdo and Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala are not directly comparable. One published cartoons that many found objectionable because they lampooned their faith; the other seemingly <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> with a terrorist who had killed Jews simply because they were Jews. Nevertheless, the arrest of Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala after all the eulogizing of free speech over the past week suggests that the French authorities still do not understand what it means.France&#39;s attitude to free speech is fraught. On one hand, the republic prides itself as the nation of Voltaire, with a tradition of trenchant <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> satire - to which Charlie Hebdo clearly saw itself as heir. On the other hand, France has restrictive <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws, some of the toughest hate speech <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> in the European Union and a ban on Holocaust denial. This combination of Voltairean bravado and restrictive measures has created a deeply contradictory attitude toward free speech.The Roman Catholic Church was a favorite target for French satirists, but its power and influence have long since declined. French anticlericalism has found instead a new object: Islam. But Islam plays a complex role in French society. France&#39;s North African communities are predominantly secular, but within them, Islam acts as a deeply conservative force. At the same time, politicians and pundits often present Islam as a threat to French values and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> and insist on labeling the whole North African population as Muslim. This creates a perception of North African communities as not really being part of the French nation, and justifies discrimination against them.At the same time, a consciousness of the sordid history of French anti-Semitism - from the Dreyfus affair to the Vichy regime - means that writers and cartoonists are far less willing to cross the line when it comes to making jokes about Jews or Judaism than they are about Muslims or Islam.It is not difficult to understand why many, particularly within North African communities, see in this a case of unequal treatment - of certain communities having special protections, while others have to put up with hatred and offense. For some inhabitants of the banlieues, this has only encouraged disengagement from mainstream society, fueled conspiracy theories and entrenched anti-Semitic views.No one has more deftly fused anti-Semitism and anti-system hatred than Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala. And the attempts to silence him have merely sharpened his supporters&#39; sense of being discriminated against and despised.What is the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> response to such hypocrisy and double standards? One approach is to insist that the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> against hate speech should be extended, so that Islam, for instance, gets equal protection from insult. This is the argument of many Muslim activists and antiracist campaigners. But this is to confuse the giving of offense with the promotion of hatred. It is also to betray those within Muslim communities who are fighting against reactionary religious ideas and institutions.Social change cannot happen without causing offense. &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t say that!&#39;&#39; is all too often the response of those in power to having that power challenged. To accept that certain things cannot be said is to accept that certain forms of power cannot be challenged. Those who most suffer from such censorship are minorities themselves.The other way to confront double standards is not by extending restrictions, but by extending speech. Mr. M&#39;bala M&#39;bala may be an anti-Semite, but he should have the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to express his bigotry. To talk of freedom of expression for everyone but bigots is to hollow out the principle.One cannot, in any case, challenge prejudice in practice by banning it; that simply lets the sentiments fester underground. It is only through freedom of expression that we can articulate our disagreements and truly challenge - and, if necessary, mock - the ideas of others, whether they are bigots or not.To end this damaging and divisive double standard, we need to permit more, not less, speech.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Policing with a Facebook of the mind;&#39;Super recognizer&#39; helps Scotland Yard match hazy images to suspects</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1318</span>
FULL TEXTOn a sticky August afternoon in 2011, as rioters looted shops in the streets outside, a small number of police officers gathered in a room in North London.Projected on the wall was the blurry silhouette of a man with a black woolen hat pulled deep over his forehead and a red bandanna covering all but his eyes. Security cameras across the city had tracked the man setting fire to cars, stealing from shops, beating up passers-by and hurling gasoline bombs.But he was always masked.&#39;&#39;We need to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> this fellow,&#39;&#39; the sergeant said. &#39;&#39;He&#39;s one of the worst.&#39;&#39;At that moment, Gary Collins, a constable with the gang unit, walked in. He took one look and said, &#39;&#39;That&#39;s Stephen Prince.&#39;&#39;Friends call Constable Collins Rain Man or Yoda or The Oracle. But at Scotland Yard, London&#39;s police force, he is a &#39;&#39;super recognizer.&#39;&#39; He has a special gift of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recall powers that enables him to match even low-quality and partial imagery to a face he has seen before, on the street or in a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> and sometimes years earlier. The last time he had come face-to-face with Mr. Prince was in a fleeting encounter in 2005.Soft-spoken and gentle-mannered, Constable Collins carries a baton and pepper spray, but no gun. His weapon is his memory: Facial recognition software managed to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> one suspect of the 4,000 captured by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> cameras during the London riots. Constable Collins <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> 180.&#39;&#39;Computers are no match for the super recognizers,&#39;&#39; said Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville, head of the Central Forensic Image Team at Scotland Yard and mastermind of the squad.With its estimated one million <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> cameras, London is pioneering a whole new area of detection, one that could be cheaper than DNA analysis and fingerprinting and relies above all on human superpowers.Scotland Yard&#39;s ever-expanding team of 152 super recognizers is made up of men and women from across the force who score at the top end of a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition test devised at Harvard in 2009. Constable Collins, the star of the unit, is in the rarefied 1 percent range.Traffic police and jailers, those patrolling neighborhoods and officers who specialize in violent crime, the super recognizers have more than tripled the number of identifications since April 2013. They are deployed to pick out known thieves and sexual offenders in crowds of tens of thousands at rock concerts and to round up pickpockets at tourist spots like Buckingham Palace and Oxford Circus. This year, they solved the high-profile murder of a teenage girl that had led to the mobilization of 600 police officers across eight forces, the biggest search operation here since the terrorist bombings of 2005.The term was coined in 2009 by Richard Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard. He was studying prosopagnosics, or those with face blindness, and found that about 2 percent of people had a very poor ability to recognize faces. Then he grew curious: Were there people at the other extreme, with extraordinary <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recall?Mr. Russell, now an associate professor of psychology at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, tested four individuals who believed they had superior face-recognition ability. The tests included the Cambridge Face Memory Test, using images with no hair or other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> clues, and a Before They Were Famous Test, in which participants have to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> celebrities from photographs taken mostly when they were children. All four participants scored far above the controls. Since then, larger-scale tests <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">predict</span> that 1 or 2 percent of people are super recognizers.Around the same time in London, Detective Neville was fighting a lonely battle with his superiors to put in place a system for circulating images of suspects caught on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> cameras. &#39;&#39;We had all the evidence, but we weren&#39;t using it,&#39;&#39; he said in an interview. &#39;&#39;The idea was that the cameras themselves would deter the bad guys. They didn&#39;t.&#39;&#39;Skeptics complained that he wanted to pay officers &#39;&#39;to watch television.&#39;&#39; <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> advocates warned of intrusiveness and misidentifications. Even psychologists were doubtful. When Detective Neville asked Josh Davis of Greenwich University in April 2011 to test some of his best officers, Mr. Davis did not expect to find much.But the test, of an initial 20 police officers with above average identification records, surprised both men: Most of the officers scored well above average, and a handful, including Constable Collins, were off the charts.When rioting broke out in August that year and 200,000 hours of camera views with thousands of images of suspects flooded in, the early super recognizers got their first assignment. They <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> 609 suspects, two in three of whom went to court. Ninety percent of those charged were convicted. Mr. Prince, the masked man picked out by Constable Collins, got six years, one of the longest sentences of all.Evolutionary psychologists are intrigued by super recognizers. Their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recall is rarely matched by photographic memory in other parts of their lives. Constable Collins, 48, who studied design before he became a police officer, has <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> over 800 suspects but cannot remember a shopping list. &#39;&#39;I have to write that down,&#39;&#39; he said.An unassuming man with cropped graying hair and a soft Cockney lilt, Constable Collins patrols the same streets in North London he grew up in. He has become famous among colleagues and villains alike. The officer sitting opposite him in their gloomy ground-floor office likens his mind to a Rolodex: &#39;&#39;You show him a photo, 30 seconds later the name pops up. And he&#39;s always on the mark.&#39;&#39;Once, in a police van after a raid, a gang leader who had been arrested asked, &#39;&#39;Who ID&#39;d me? Who is this Gary Collins?&#39;&#39; When Constable Collins put up his hand, he said, &#39;&#39;Man, everyone in prison is talking about you.&#39;&#39; They still see each other on the street now and again.&#39;&#39;He&#39;ll test me on his gang mates: &#39;What&#39;s his name?&#39; he&#39;ll ask,&#39;&#39; Constable Collins said. &#39;&#39;When I tell them they cheer and give me a high five.&#39;&#39;As a child, Constable Collins was oblivious to his talent. &#39;&#39;I always recognized people, but as a kid you don&#39;t know you have a gift, you just think everybody is like you.&#39;&#39;The son of a telephone engineer and a veterinary receptionist, he would beat his family and friends at ordering the colors on a Rubik&#39;s Cube. He was bad in school but good at art, with a particular aptitude for drawing portraits. Before exams, he would fill a little book with colorful diagrams and mnemonics.&#39;&#39;They called me The Book,&#39;&#39; he said.But it was only when he joined the force in 1995 that he became aware of his gift. The new boy on the beat in Greenwich, in London&#39;s southeast, he would spend hours looking at the worn Polaroid prints of neighborhood villains on the wall. &#39;&#39;I was drawn to those pictures,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I used to look at them all the time.&#39;&#39;Then, out on patrol for the first time with a senior officer, he would reel off the names of the people they came across. &#39;&#39;How the hell would you know, new boy?&#39;&#39; his partner asked him.Off duty, super recognition can be a curse. Recently, Constable Collins almost got punched. &#39;&#39;I think sometimes I stare a bit too long, but I can&#39;t help it,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This guy I was looking at was like, &#39;What are you looking at? What are you looking at?&#39;&#39;&#39;He deliberately lives outside London to avoid running into wanted faces from his beat. Recently, he had to cut short an outing to the mall with his sons when he recognized a gaggle of gang members while buying sneakers.He reckons that his oldest son, 11 and soccer-obsessed, could be a super recognizer. &#39;&#39;He knows football players in countries and teams I haven&#39;t even heard of,&#39;&#39; Constable Collins said. &#39;&#39;Who knows? He might have the gift.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Terror threat complicates border concerns;Likelihood that attacker arrived with migrants adds burden on Europe</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1187</span>
FULL TEXTThe increasing likelihood that one of the Paris attackers entered Europe with a Syrian passport last month, amid the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war and persecution, has alarmed leaders and renewed talk about tightening border controls.But after months of discussion on exactly that point - and as many leaders and others warned that infiltration by would-be attackers was a grim possibility - Europe is no closer to resolving the issue, nor even agreeing on what must be done to reduce that risk.European leaders and some experts said the terrorism question just makes the flow of migrants over the union&#39;s borders more politically loaded and the burdens on border officials even more daunting.&#39;&#39;Securitywise, a situation that was complicated before has just gotten much more complicated,&#39;&#39; said Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, a nongovernmental group based in Brussels and a former European Union ambassador to Turkey and Syria.And the need to serve both migrants and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> interests burdens a system - and people - who are poorly equipped to deal with both.&#39;&#39;The Paris attacks have put a lot of pressure on border officials and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> services in all countries, including in Austria,&#39;&#39; said Peter Webinger, a senior official for migration and asylum in Austria&#39;s Interior Ministry. &#39;&#39;We really need to be extremely cautious, and I emphasize this strongly, not to mix migration process and terrorism.&#39;&#39;Part of the complication involves the different kinds of borders in Europe: the outer border, such as between Turkey and Greece, which marks the boundaries of the European Union, and internal boundaries between the bloc&#39;s countries, known as the Schengen Area of visa-free travel.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been pressing appeals to Italy, Greece and Turkey to secure Europe&#39;s external borders and thus preserve freedom of movement in the Schengen zone.That position is shared by President François Hollande of France, who on Monday, even after increasing evidence that the attackers came from both outside the European Union and from within it, stressed that erecting walls and fences &#39;&#39;would be the end of Europe.&#39;&#39;Despite growing internal pressure to do so, Ms. Merkel has stressed that Germany will not emulate Hungary, which fenced shut its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia. Germany has about almost 2,200 miles of land borders, including a 500-mile border with Austria, where refugees arrive after traveling via Turkey, Greece and the Balkans.Her concerns about protecting Europe&#39;s open borders have been matched by the lack of practicality in shutting them, especially in recent months, as hundreds of thousands of migrants took to land routes and trudged from country to country toward the heart of Europe.That human tide has left <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> forces all along the trail from Greece through Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria with little choice but to let migrants on through to their desired destinations of Germany or Scandinavia.Checks conducted en route vary, leaving the authorities with an incomplete picture.Recent arrivals in Berlin said in interviews on Monday that they themselves favored more <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> checks. Mobi Clureshi, 24, now helping as a translator at Berlin&#39;s main refugee registration center, said he arrived from his native Pakistan via Russia three months ago. He went to Paris shortly before Germany, and said he felt unsafe in its multicultural environment.&#39;&#39;I think they allow too many people to get in,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t check everyone.&#39;&#39; Fingerprinting should be more widespread, he suggested. &#39;&#39;When you cross a border and you have a system like that, the world would be more secure.&#39;&#39;Some 5,000 refugees are arriving daily at the five crossing points between Bavaria and Austria. The authorities try to take everyone&#39;s fingerprints and check all <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> documents, but the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> is not <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> because of German legal protections of privacy, Johannes Dimroth, a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry, said on Monday.However, most of the new arrivals are applying for asylum, and are taken to a registration center, where they are formally registered before a much more thorough check and an interview - with a translator if necessary - as the asylum application is reviewed, Mr. Dimroth said.The countries that the migrants enter before reaching Germany have even fewer protections. For Austria, which more than 500,000 people have traveled through this year, only just over 70,000 requested asylum. The large majority are not registered because the country has insufficient infrastructure to do so, Interior Ministry officials in Vienna said, and most migrants refuse to be registered before they reach the country in which they want to settle.In Slovenia, now the most common point to enter Austria after the trek through the Balkans, more than 220,000 people have passed through since Oct. 17, when Hungary closed its border with Croatia and forced the migrants to shift further west.Slovenia has started constructing a razor-wire fence on its 400-mile southern border with Croatia - a measure it insists is not shutting the frontier, but merely controlling the influx and thus enforcing the Schengen zone. Once in Slovenia, migrants are fingerprinted, and in most cases their picture is taken, and their names and documents are entered into a European database. Names are also checked against databanks of criminal records.Many migrants show up without documents at all. They are registered with names and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> they give to border personnel, Slovenian officials said. Only 79 migrants so far have requested asylum in Slovenia.Most of the migrants arrive in Slovenia from the Balkan trail that starts in Macedonia and goes to Serbia, which is neither in the European Union or the Schengen zone, but where some 430,000 migrants have been registered passing through this year. Interior Ministry officials declined to say whether fingerprints were taken or <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> documents examined. Only 548 people sought asylum in Serbia this year, officials said.Ms. Merkel has failed to win support for swift distribution of refugees amid more countries, and promised registration centers in Greece and Italy are not yet functional. Still, Europeans are taking steps to enhance security, said Mr. Pierini at Carnegie Europe.More police officers from member states will be sent to external borders in Greece and Slovenia, he said, and intelligence services will coordinate and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> information.&#39;&#39;If the E.U. can get its act together, proper screening of migrants would take place in various countries of entry, starting with Greece - and also Turkey, if they could convince Turkey,&#39;&#39; Mr. Pierini said.&#39;&#39;That would be the only way to make sure that people who are migrating to Europe are genuine asylum-seekers, and not terrorist operatives in disguise,&#39;&#39; he said, while adding that &#39;&#39;the risks of that happening among tens of thousands has so far been very low.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">WikiLeaks Isn&#39;t Whistleblowing;Contributing Op-Ed Writer</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1143</span>
FULL TEXTI once asked Daniel Ellsberg - who in 1971 leaked the secret history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers - if he had any regrets. He told me, as he told many others, that he regretted only that he had not leaked them earlier, when they might have had more impact and perhaps shortened the war.Whistle-blowing, as Mr. Ellsberg did, is a time-honored means for exposing the secret machinations of the powerful. But the release of huge amounts of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">hacked</span> data, with no apparent oversight or curation, does the opposite. Such leaks threaten our ability to dissent by destroying <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and unleashing a glut of questionable <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful.The latest example of these <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> dumps comes from WikiLeaks, which is releasing the emails of Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign chairman, John Podesta, in dribs and drabs going back to 2008, when Mr. Podesta was the co-chairman of Barack Obama&#39;s transition team.&#34;Wait,&#34; you might think. John Podesta is about as far from dissident politics as you can get. These leaks have produced genuine news. We finally got to see the text of Mrs. Clinton&#39;s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, for example. What&#39;s wrong with that? Doesn&#39;t that serve the public interest?The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">hacked</span> emails did provide the public with some notable information. But any benefit of such mass <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> releases does not undo their harm. And that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">harm</span> is relevant whether or not the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> was stolen by a foreign government seeking to influence this election.The victims here are not just Mr. Podesta and the people in his contacts list who are embarrassed or compromised. The victim of leaks of private communication is the ability of dissidents to function in a democracy.Demanding transparency from the powerful is not a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to see every single private email anyone in a position of power ever sent or received. WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its millions of followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide; news outlets repeated the report.Wanton destruction of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> of any person who has ever come near a political organization is a vicious but effective means to smother dissent. This method is so common in Russia and the former Soviet states that it has a name: &#34;kompromat,&#34; releasing compromising material against political opponents. Emails of dissidents are hacked, their houses bugged, the activities in their bedrooms videotaped, and the material made public to embarrass and intimidate people whose politics displeases the powerful. Kompromat does not have to go after every single dissident to work: If you know that getting near politics means that your <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> may be destroyed, you will understandably stay away.Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens&#39; emails and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members. Dissent requires the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to privacy: to be let alone in our vulnerabilities and the ability to form our thoughts and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> them when we choose. These hacks undermine that crucial right.Mass <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> releases, like the Podesta emails, conflate things that the public has a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to know with things we have no business knowing, with a lot of material in the middle about things we may be curious about and may be of some historical interest, but should not be released in this manner.All campaigns need to have internal discussions. Taking one campaign manager&#39;s email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing.These hacks also function as a form of censorship. Once, censorship worked by blocking crucial pieces of information. In this era of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> overload, censorship works by drowning us in too much undifferentiated information, crippling our ability to focus. These dumps, combined with the news media&#39;s obsession with campaign trivia and gossip, have resulted in whistle-drowning, rather than whistle-blowing: In a sea of so many whistles blowing so loud, we cannot hear a single one.What is the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> response, then, to living in a world where we will see more mass hacks of information, and more titillating and occasionally newsworthy private communication made public?The answer is not simply to tell people to stop writing things down. &#34;Don&#39;t discuss things over email if you don&#39;t want to see them on CNN&#34; is the new &#34;don&#39;t wear a miniskirt if you don&#39;t want to get assaulted.&#34; That would take us back to the pre-internet world where only the powerful could communicate with ease. People with resources will create their own online gated communities - buying more expensive, secure devices, hiring specialists and flying around more to meet in person - while dissident groups with fewer resources will be left behind.Since these hackers won&#39;t stop, we need to build resilience by emphasizing curation, context and ethics, and by no longer acting as if something that has been <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">hacked</span> and dumped is all up for grabs.Journalism ethics have to transition from the time of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> scarcity to the current realities of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> glut and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> invasion. For example, obsessively reporting on internal campaign discussions about strategy from the (long ago) primary, in the last month of a general election against a different opponent, is not responsible journalism. Out-of-context emails from WikiLeaks have fueled viral misinformation on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> media. Journalists should focus on the few important revelations, but also help debunk false misinformation that is proliferating on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> media.Those of us who aren&#39;t reporters need better ways to respond, too. These hacks are done to steal our attention and to confuse us; the only effective response is to refuse to play this game on the hackers&#39; terms.In old-school <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> journalism, journalists trade <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> for docile coverage, and we are often served gossip or trivia: the kind the powerful would like us to know. In this form of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">hacked</span> emails, we still get gossip and trivia. But we get the kind the hackers want us to focus on, while distracting us from the real issues.We can&#39;t shrug off these dangers just because these hackers have, so far, largely made relatively powerful people and groups their targets. Their true target is the health of our democracy.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science and a contributing opinion writer.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Web laws are bad for Google - and us</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 792</span>
FULL TEXTIt&#39;s been a rough few months for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> in Europe. Not only has the European Union hit the company with a second antitrust investigation, but - in a move that has received less press, but could have wider consequences - French regulators have pushed it to restrict search results all over the world to comply with their &#39;&#39;right to be forgotten&#39;&#39; <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws.That&#39;s a problem for a company whose business model is built on search. But it may be an even bigger problem for Internet users. If a European government can control what people all over the world get to see on the Internet, why can&#39;t every other country do the same?The back-and-forth between Europe and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> is the latest fallout from a 2014 <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">ruling</span> from Europe&#39;s highest court that gave people broad rights to make search engines remove search results about themselves, including links to news articles and other information. People with connections to Europe can file requests with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> to have certain links removed from search results.Google responded by taking search results out of its European versions: Visitors to google.fr or google.de wouldn&#39;t see the banned results, but they were still there on google.com. Still, Europeans could navigate to the company&#39;s non-European versions. In March French regulators fined the company and said these steps were not enough.Technically, the French may have a point. When Europeans type &#39;&#39;google.com&#39;&#39; into their browsers, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> directs them to their national versions of the service - which, it says, are used by 95 percent of its European users. But <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> hadn&#39;t erected barriers to stop those people from visiting google.com.In a concession to regulators, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> is changing that now, using &#39;&#39;geo-blocking&#39;&#39; technology to control what European users can see. Under the new system, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> will not only remove links on, say, google.fr, but it will block users in France from seeing those links on any other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> country site, or google.com itself. Unless they use tools like virtual private networks to disguise their locations, users in those countries will see pruned search results.Some say this is a logical solution - avoiding global deletion, while letting a sovereign state enforce its laws, within its borders. But it is a big step away from the Internet&#39;s promise of universally accessible information, and a big step toward a world of &#39;&#39;splinternets.&#39;&#39;There are several problems with this. Chopping up important parts of the web raises barriers to entry for anyone looking to set up online, from independent bloggers to nongovernmental organizations to businesses. Smaller online services are unlikely to build bespoke French versions, as <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> has done. It is easier and cheaper to block French users entirely. That means new entrants miss out on the French market, French Internet users miss out on new content and technologies from abroad, and everyone everywhere misses out on the creativity and innovation that comes from participating in a global Internet.Walling off national Internet sectors also lends legitimacy to countries like China, Turkey and Iran that have long controlled what <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> their citizens can view online. Just this month, the United States Trade Representative made waves by identifying one such blocking system, China&#39;s so-called Great Firewall, as a barrier to trade.News outlets should have particular cause for alarm about geo-blocking. Journalists rely on global networks to investigate and report on international stories, like the recent Panama Papers revelations. They themselves are often the first targets when governments seek to control the flow of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to their citizens. Protection exists in European Union <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> for journalistic activities, so the news <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> is not directly in the cross hairs of the &#39;&#39;right to be forgotten.&#39;&#39; But American news organizations have faced libel actions in hostile foreign courts - and when plaintiffs start asking for geo-blocking in those cases, journalists will be on the front lines.Privacy is a real issue, and shouldn&#39;t be ignored in the Internet age. But applying those national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> to the Internet needs to be handled with more nuance and concern. These developments should not be driven only by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulators. State departments, trade and justice ministries and telecom regulators in France and other European countries should be demanding a place at the table. So should free-expression advocates.One day, international agreements may sort this all out. But we shouldn&#39;t Balkanize the Internet in the meantime. Once we&#39;ve erected barriers online, we might not be able to tear them down.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">A &#39;no buy&#39; list on guns</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 936</span>
FULL TEXTThe massacre in Florida is a horrifying reminder that terrorists don&#39;t need airplanes to kill scores of people: All they need are commonplace firearms. Gun-control groups are already issuing calls to do more to keep suspected terrorists from buying guns, while those against stricter gun <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> say we shouldn&#39;t deny people their constitutional rights on the basis of mere suspicion. They are both correct. But there is a solution.Federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> bars felons, the mentally ill, drug addicts and people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing firearms. Nothing, however, prevents a suspected terrorist from walking into a gun store and buying as many guns as he wants. According to a report by the F.B.I., more than 200 people on the terrorist watch list legally bought guns from federally licensed dealers in 2010.Islamic terrorists seem to be well aware of this loophole, and some have urged their followers in America to take advantage of our lax gun laws. In a 2011 video, a spokesman for Al Qaeda noted the easy availability of weapons in the United States and asked sympathizers, &#39;&#39;So what are you waiting for?&#39;&#39;Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has kept suspected terrorists from boarding airplanes by placing them on no-fly lists. Isn&#39;t it time we also had no-buy lists? In a speech on Monday, Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, seemed to support this idea, saying, &#39;&#39;If you&#39;re too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.&#39;&#39;Although endorsed by both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, the creation of something like a no-buy list has been vigorously opposed by the National Rifle Association. The gun lobby objects that the administrations&#39; proposals would give the attorney general too much discretion over who is put on such a list. No one should be deprived of constitutional rights on the shaky ground that the attorney general merely suspects the person might be a terrorist.We should take the N.R.A.&#39;s criticisms seriously. Due process of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> is a vital constitutional principle and Americans have a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to own firearms for self-protection.Does this mean we should drop the idea of a no-buy list? No. It just means we need one that is fair.One promising model can be found in Fourth Amendment <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> on search and seizure. The Constitution allows the government to invade our <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> by, say, wiretapping our telephones, for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement purposes in limited circumstances. First, the prosecutor must have probable cause, or sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Second, the search must be approved by the courts.Such principles, which were part of the framers&#39; broad conception of due process, have not always been followed when it comes to national security, from the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II to the Bush administration&#39;s warrantless <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> program. Yet those principles can provide a sound basis for no-buy lists.Congress should authorize no-buy lists but mandate that appropriate protections be put in place. If the attorney general believes a suspected terrorist should be added to the list, she should have to go to court first and offer up evidence. Only after concluding that the attorney general has probable cause should the court approve the denial of the suspect&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to buy a gun.This court proceeding, of course, would be secret. Although that denies the person included on the no-buy list the opportunity to rebut the attorney general&#39;s evidence, we do the same thing every day with search warrants and wiretaps for criminal suspects. Our <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to bear arms is no more fundamental than our <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to privacy, and treating them similarly can help keep us safer from terrorists.For maximum secrecy, Congress could assign these probable cause determinations to the jurisdiction of the existing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The judges on this court have a deep understanding of the nation&#39;s national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> threats.Similar procedures for denying someone the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to possess firearms are already in place for domestic abusers. A person harmed or threatened by her spouse can obtain a court injunction barring the spouse from being near her. Under federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> in certain cases, the spouse will also be denied the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to have a gun.Some opponents of gun control complain because such injunctions are issued without first notifying the spouse, but the courts have consistently said the practice is constitutional.To ensure that the no-buy list isn&#39;t being abused, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> should also require that the attorney general file periodic, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">confidential</span> reports to an appropriate congressional oversight committee where pro-gun lawmakers can police any executive branch abuses.Of course, like any law, a no-buy list won&#39;t be a perfect solution. (And an imperfect version of a no-buy list, with tight deadline requirements, was proposed in the Senate last year.) With over 300 million guns in America and private gun sales allowed with no background check whatsoever, a determined terrorist will most likely still be able to obtain guns. Yet the easiest, most convenient way to buy guns - from a gun store, with the best prices and selection, like the one where the Orlando attacker bought his guns - wouldn&#39;t be available.The best way to honor those who died in Orlando is to do everything we can to reduce the chances of more innocent lives being lost to terrorism. And we can do it while respecting the Constitution.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Where Will Trump Stand on Press Freedoms?;Mediator</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1374</span>
FULL TEXTIt was mid-June, and relations between Donald J. Trump and the news <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> had taken another dreadful turn. He had already vowed to change the libel <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> to make it easier to sue journalists, and his <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> insults were becoming more vicious. (One news correspondent was a &#34;sleaze&#34;; another was &#34;third rate.&#34;)Most troubling was that he was keeping a blacklist of news organizations he was banning from his rallies, and it was growing.I called him at the time, to see what this would look like in a Trump administration. Would he deny White House credentials to select reporters and news organizations?No, he said. &#34;There, I&#39;m taking something away, where I&#39;m representing the nation.&#34;We can only hope he means it. Because if Mr. Trump keeps up the posture he displayed during the campaign - all-out war footing - the future will hold some very grim days, not just for news reporters but also for the American constitutional system that relies on a free and strong press.It&#39;s one thing to wage a press war as a candidate, when the most you can do is enforce reporting bans at your rallies, hurl insults and deny interviews and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> (all of which are plenty bad).It&#39;s another thing to do it from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where you have control over what vital government <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> is made public, and where you have sway over the Justice Department, which under President Obama has shown an overexuberance in investigating journalists and the whistle-blowers who <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">leak</span> to them.Imagine what somebody with a press vendetta and a dim view of the First Amendment would do with that kind of power.For their part, American newsrooms are conducting their own reassessments, vowing to do a better job covering the issues that animated his supporters, and acknowledging that Mr. Trump tapped into something in the national mood, the power of which they failed to grasp.They now know they underestimate him again at their own peril. Yet they also know that the need to continue with probing, unflinching reporting that promotes the truth in the face of whatever comes at them will be great.In the days immediately after Mr. Trump&#39;s victory, journalists that don&#39;t work at organizations with Breitbart in their names were preparing for potential reporting challenges, the likes of which they have never seen, while lawyers were gaming out possible legal strategies should Mr. Trump move against press freedoms.Right after his victory Mr. Trump was telegraphing a gentler tone, declaring to The Wall Street Journal, &#34;It&#39;s different now.&#34; Perhaps he was making his long-promised &#34;pivot&#34; to become &#34;more presidential than anybody&#34; save Abraham Lincoln.But then came the Saturday night release of his &#34;60 Minutes&#34; interview in which he said he would keep his Twitter account so that when any news organization gave him &#34;a bad story,&#34; he would &#34;have a method of fighting back.&#34;And he didn&#39;t skip a beat on Sunday morning, when he attacked The New York Times with a Twitter post that read, &#34;Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the &#39;Trump phenomena.&#39;&#34;The statement was false. The paper said Sunday that postelection cancellations were so substantially outstripped by a surge of new subscriptions that its subscription growth rate in the period that followed Tuesday&#39;s result was four times the growth rate in the same period of last quarter.In an atmosphere in which it&#39;s not shocking to hear about anti-Semitic literature being sent to the home of a Jewish reporter - the address having been published online by supporters of Mr. Trump - it was hard to see any of this as very presidential, though the definition may be changing.The funny thing is that few major political figures have had a more codependent and at times friendly relationship with the press than Mr. Trump. Before he stopped doing news briefings in the later phase of the campaign, he was shaping up to be the most accessible major-party nominee in modern history.But displeasing him could have an intensely <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> cost, which the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly vividly recalls in her new book, &#34;Settle for More.&#34;Ms. Kelly, who became Mr. Trump&#39;s leading television nemesis during the primary campaign, writes about how the candidate, unhappy with a segment she did in July 2015, threatened to unleash &#34;my beautiful Twitter account against you.&#34;After enduring her tough questioning at the first presidential primary debate, he made good on his Twitter promise, which in turn led to death threats against her, she said. (&#34;I would spend many days of the coming months accompanied by security,&#34; she writes.) It didn&#39;t help, she wrote, that Mr. Trump&#39;s special counsel, Michael Cohen, recirculated a Trump supporter&#39;s tweet that read &#34;we can gut her.&#34;That was followed by what she took as another threat, from Mr. Trump&#39;s campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski. As Mr. Lewandowski unsuccessfully lobbied a senior Fox News executive to remove Ms. Kelly from the next Fox debate, she writes, he said he would hate to see her go through such a &#34;rough couple of days&#34; again. (Fox News described the conversation the same way earlier this year.)Mr. Lewandowski had been the living embodiment of Mr. Trump&#39;s aggressive approach to the press. He was, after all, arrested on charges that he manhandled the former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields. (Prosecutors in Florida ultimately dropped the charges.)After a paid stint at CNN, Mr. Lewandowski returned to the Trump fold last week, and could wind up in the administration or at the Republican Party headquarters.Another member of Mr. Trump&#39;s transition team, the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, broke new ground this year by financing the &#34;Hulk Hogan&#34; lawsuit against Gawker, which resulted in Gawker&#39;s bankruptcy and sale to Univision.Though that was technically an invasion-of-privacy case, it was a model for what Mr. Trump has said he wants to see in opening up libel laws.Most First Amendment lawyers agree that fundamentally changing the libel <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> would require a reversal of the landmark Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan. And while that might seem like a long shot, Laura R. Handman, a First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview that Mr. Trump could find ways to &#34;chip away&#34; at it.First Amendment lawyers are more immediately concerned with potential <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">leak</span> investigations, as well as Freedom of Information <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Act</span> requests, which can provide the best way to expose government secrets.Look no farther than the potential attorney general candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as mayor of New York was so allergic to records requests that news organizations and others regularly sued him for basic information.Success at court was meaningless given that proceedings kept the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> out of public view for so long that &#34;he really won,&#34; said George Freeman, who was the assistant general counsel for The New York Times then and is now the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.I&#39;ve said it before, but the solution will be what it has always been - good, tough reporting.For all the appropriate discussion about how they missed some key dynamics of the race, mainstream news outlets produced a lot of top-flight journalism. They provided a glimpse into the tax returns Mr. Trump wouldn&#39;t share; showed how he and Mrs. Clinton ran their charities; investigated their family business dealings; and bluntly called out falsehoods, more of which came from Mr. Trump.The wrong lesson to take from the past year is that reporters should let up in their mission of reporting the truth, wherever it leads.That&#39;s more important than ever, given how adept Mr. Trump and his allies have proved to be at promoting conspiracy theories that can spread faster than ever through <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> media.But if there is one thing we learned this year, it was the wisdom of the old mnemonic device for the spelling of &#34;assume&#34; (makes an &#34;ass&#34; out of &#34;u&#34; and &#34;me&#34;). Mr. Trump campaigned through surprise and may well govern through surprise. We&#39;ll know how this thing is going to go only when we know.Now, where&#39;s my seatbelt?

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Newspaper Shooting Shows Widening Use of Facial Recognition by Authorities</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1219</span>
FULL TEXTSAN FRANCISCO - When the police apprehended a suspect for the shootings at The Capital Gazette&#39;s newsroom in Annapolis, Md., on Thursday, he refused to divulge his name. So the authorities <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> the man, Jarrod Ramos, using a different method: <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition technology.The revelation shone a spotlight on just how easily and how quickly officials can pinpoint suspects using a technology that is increasingly pervasive in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement. Over the past few years, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition has been quietly adopted by the authorities across the United States - including at the local <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policing</span> level - and become part of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">standard</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement toolkit.Sixteen states let the Federal Bureau of Investigation use the technology to compare the faces of suspected criminals to driver&#39;s license and ID photos, according to a report from the Georgetown Law Center on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> and Technology. And thanks to recent improvements to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition by some of the world&#39;s largest tech companies, its influence in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policing</span> is likely to grow.&#34;Face recognition is one of the most important developments in crime fighting since the discovery of fingerprinting in the 19th century,&#34; said Joseph J. Atick, a pioneer in face recognition technology and executive chairman of ID4Africa, which works with African governments to institute national identification systems. &#34;It&#39;s hard to imagine a police department in the United States with more than 10 to 15 cops in it that does not have <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to face recognition.&#34;The use of the technology in the Capital Gazette shooting comes amid a broader debate about <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition&#39;s role in policing. Proponents see it as a powerful tool for catching criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that it can be an instrument of mass <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> that threatens people&#39;s ability to anonymously go about their business.That debate has heated up as tech companies like Amazon have recently drawn criticism for providing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition technology to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement agencies. Last month, more than two dozen civil rights organizations asked Amazon to stop selling its <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition system - called Rekognition - to the authorities.The civil rights groups argued that Rekognition was overly powerful - according to Amazon&#39;s web site, it can not only <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">track</span> individuals, it can also detect &#34;up to 100 faces in challenging crowded photos,&#34; as well as license plates captured by traffic cameras. That means the system could potentially ensnare many ordinary citizens, rather than being limited only to people committing crimes.In the case of the Capital Gazette shooting, police did not use <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition in a way that violated people&#39;s privacy, according to experts in the technology. They noted that the police were merely confirming the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> of a suspect whom they already had in custody, as opposed to trying to find a criminal in an enormous <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> of people.Timothy Altomare, chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland, said on Friday that the police used the Maryland Image Repository System to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> Mr. Ramos when he did not cooperate with investigators. They initially tried to learn Mr. Ramos&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identity</span> through his fingerprints, he said. But with the fingerprint identification moving slowly, they quickly switched to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition.Specifically, a photo of Mr. Ramos was sent to the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center, which searched the repository of driver&#39;s license photos and mug shots to find a match, said Mr. Altomare.&#34;We would have been much longer in identifying him and being able to push forward,&#34; Mr. Altomare said about why the image system was used.The progression of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition technology has been rapid. Computing systems can now examine a photo or video footage of a face and match it to an image in an existing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> of faces, all with an accuracy that rivals human sight, something that was not possible just five years ago. These systems also typically scan <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">databases</span> far quicker than human analysts.Even in the technology&#39;s earliest days, it piqued the interest of intelligence agencies and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement officials. American military and intelligence agencies used <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition for years in Iraq and Afghanistan to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> potential terrorists. More recently, it has caught on at dozens of police departments around the United States to pursue drug dealers, prostitutes and other conventional criminal suspects.That adoption is likely to accelerate as more companies - such as Amazon, NEC and Cognitec - widen their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition offerings. The hardware and software that underpins the technology has also become less expensive, pushing myriad start-ups and other companies to enter the market.Police departments and individuals can even build similar technology on their own with relative ease.&#34;If a police department hired me for a summer internship, I could cook them up a decent face recognition <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">algorithm</span> - not that I am offering my services,&#34; said Jonathan Frankle, an artificial intelligence researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped write a study of face recognition technology at the Georgetown Law Center for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> and Technology.Questions about <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and concerns about potential misuse of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition are also likely to increase, especially as the systems require a large <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> of images that faces can be matched against. The F.B.I. has a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> that spans 400 million images, according to a recent report from the General Accounting Office. The Maryland Image Repository System contains millions of images from motor vehicle records.Many local <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement agencies may run criminal searches against state <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">databases</span> of driver&#39;s license photos, involving millions of citizens in a kind of government <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> they didn&#39;t sign up for, said Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization.&#34;People who are in a driver&#39;s license <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> did not agree to be part of a criminal search every time the police are looking for a suspect,&#34; Ms. Lynch said. &#34;A civil photograph should not be subject to search for criminal purposes.&#34;One added concern is that face recognition systems sometimes make mistakes, matching an image to the wrong person. &#34;Depending on how good your image is, the accuracy can vary wildly,&#34; Mr. Frankle said.That&#39;s especially so when photos are taken by overhead <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> cameras, which do not always provide a clear and straightforward image. Even in good conditions, face recognition technology fails at least part of the time. And those failures may increase as <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">databases</span> of potential suspects grow and there are more chances of mistaken outcomes, said Mr. Frankle.&#34;The accuracy of these systems depends on so many things, including the size of your database,&#34; said Mr. Frankle. &#34;The technology may get worse as the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">database</span> gets bigger.&#34;Follow Cade Metz and Natasha Singer on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @natashanyt Cade Metz reported from San Francisco and Natasha Singer from New York.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Wayne LaPierre&#39;s Unconstitutionalism;Op-Ed Contributor</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1118</span>
FULL TEXTWayne LaPierre is rarely accused of progressivism. But when Mr. LaPierre, the leader of the National Rifle Association, addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, he invoked the Second Amendment in much the same way that a significant portion of the left has long spoken of the rights it values. According to this conception, rights are zones of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> autonomy where the individual owes no explanation and the community has no jurisdiction. This manner of thinking about rights is a serious barrier to reasonable regulations of firearms. The N.R.A. ritually claims the mantle of the Constitution, but the American founders who framed it had a far richer view in which individual rights were subject to considerations of the common good.There may be good reasons not to regulate firearms further, but the individual&#39;s absolute claim that his or her guns are nobody&#39;s business is not one of them. To even make this assertion is an illustration of what the legal scholar and diplomat Mary Ann Glendon calls &#34;the illusion of absoluteness,&#34; an idea that is hostile to the possibility of political community. All rights have limits. The question is who determines them. For the framers of the Constitution, the answer was that the people do.One of the earliest American assertions of rights, the 1641 Massachusetts Body of Liberties, delineated rights against everything from banishment to dismemberment but subjected them to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">regulation</span> by the legislature. The community could take these actions only according to rules known in advance and equally applicable to all. The essence of rights in this early understanding was the rule of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> - as propounded by the community - not the isolation of the individual.The Declaration of Independence, whose &#34;unalienable rights&#34; individualists are so quick to claim for themselves, dealt with rights similarly. In legal parlance, to &#34;alienate&#34; something is to exchange it for an equivalent - precisely what individuals do with their rights when they form a political community. The Declaration&#39;s rights are coherently &#34;unalienable&#34; only if they are possessed by what the document calls &#34;one people.&#34; This interpretation is backed by the fact that many of the complaints against King George that the document proceeds to enumerate are not that he did something absolutely forbidden but rather that he did so without the legislature&#39;s consent.In one of his cheaper applause lines, Mr. LaPierre cut to the heart of this issue: &#34;We, the people, are in charge of this country,&#34; he declared. But polls show that the people overwhelmingly support more restrictions on guns. As Randy E. Barnett, a constitutional theorist whose conception of individual liberty animated the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act, has written, everything hinges on whether &#34;we the people&#34; refers to a community or a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of individuals. Mr. Barnett concludes the latter, as apparently does Mr. LaPierre, who went on to repeatedly invoke &#34;individual rights&#34; as the essence of the American republic.In this, they differ from James Madison, the man behind the Bill of Rights. Introducing his amendments to Congress with the lukewarm remark that they were not &#34;altogether useless,&#34; Madison cast them as a protection for the people against the encroachments of the government, not as a means of preventing the majority of the people from acting on its understanding of the public good.On the contrary, Madison specifically rued the fact that his amendments would not prevent the majority from abusing the minority. Madison thought the Bill of Rights might help discourage the community from abusing political minorities, but he did not see it as a legal barrier to majority decisions. Instead, Madison wrote that in situations in which political minorities were aggrieved, they were responsible for persuading the majority of their views and had to acquiesce if they failed. Alexander Hamilton argued that the Constitution&#39;s invocation of &#34;we the people&#34; better protected what he suggestively called &#34;popular rights&#34; than their formal recitation in a Bill of Rights.Far from being absolute, the Second Amendment is perhaps the clearest example of the Constitution situating rights in the context of the public good. It refers to the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> of &#34;the people&#34; to keep and bear arms because the framers of the Constitution preferred state militias to a standing national army. The public context of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> is similar to the difference between the Constitution protecting the capacity of speech, which would allow the proverbial cry of &#34;fire&#34; in a crowded theater, and the First Amendment&#39;s reference to &#34;freedom&#34; of speech. The latter is a legal concept that incorporates the possibility of limits.This political conception of rights - that they can be adjusted for the public good, subject to the rule of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> - largely prevailed until the courts began understanding rights as instruments of individual fulfillment and desire. The inevitable result was what the conservative political philosopher Harvey C. Mansfield has called the belief that &#34;no <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> is <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">safe</span> unless it can be carried to an extreme.&#34;In this sense, Mr. LaPierre&#39;s rights rhetoric has far more in common with the political opponents whom he stigmatizes as socialists than he acknowledges. It is a staple of progressive rhetoric on individual rights that they must be protected at their outer limits lest exercises of freedom short of the extremes become threatened. Assertions of speech and press rights that would accord pornography nearly boundless First Amendment protection lest the nation tumble down the slippery slope to political censorship partake of this tendency. So does the ever-expanding <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to privacy, support for which often takes the form of arguing that if the government is allowed to restrict one activity, it will be similarly empowered to regulate others.This rigidly individualist understanding of rights is a bipartisan phenomenon. The insistence on an absolute interpretation of rights leads to the absurdity of all-or-nothing solutions like arming everyone, including classroom teachers, rather than regulating anyone. The slaughters at a high school in Florida, a church in Texas and a concert in Las Vegas suggest that the common good is not only an older <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">standard</span> for rights but also a better one.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Taming the Apex Predators of Tech</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1036</span>
FULL TEXTIn a tech galaxy that now seems far, far away, everyone was terrified of Bill Gates. He was the Apex Predator of Tech.You wanted to make software? Microsoft would crush you. You wanted to start an online service? Microsoft would decimate you. You wanted to make a browser to navigate the World Wide Web? Chomp!It was that last one that finally stopped Mr. Gates and Microsoft. The government accused the company of being a monopoly and of engaging in anticompetitive practices against Netscape and its Navigator browser. In 2001 the government won a landmark case against the company that required it to submit to more oversight and make it easier for other companies to offer competing software.The Sherman Antitrust <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Act</span> had prevailed over the leading power in tech, and what happened after was a resurgence of innovation that ushered in a spate of new companies and ideas. You can draw a pretty straight line from that decision to the growth of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and Amazon and Apple, the explosion of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and the introduction of start-ups like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Slack.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Yay, capitalism and unfettered markets! Boo, a concentration of control!In recent years tech has backtracked, except this time we have several Apex Predators instead of just one. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> are the most obvious. More and more people in the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> and in politics, as well as consumers, have become fearful of these companies for the damage they can do and the unregulated power they wield.Something has to be done, but what? Even as distrust of big tech companies increases and governments move to control them, their businesses have never been more successful.One option is <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> legislation. Europe passed such a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> in 2016. While there is no national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> in the United States, California will soon have a state-level law, and other states are considering similar reforms. The idea of restricting tech companies&#39; use of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> becomes more popular with every <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">hack</span> and every instance of abuse. Still, the likelihood of the United States passing a national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> with teeth is small.Then there are the fines, such as a multibillion-dollar one that the Federal Trade Commission is considering to punish <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> violations. While the fine would be the largest the agency has ever levied, it would also be far too small to make a difference. When <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> announced it might have to hand over $5 billion as its get-out-of-jail-free card, Wall Street cheered and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> stock rose.Meanwhile, there&#39;s a lot of talk about the ways that countries can work together to improve the online ecosystem. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand met with President Emmanuel Macron of France last week, for example, about creating an intergovernmental effort to end online extremism. While laudable in theory, very little of this hand-wringing is likely to result in any rules with heft. In addition, the prospect of governments making rules around the restriction of speech is rife with ethical dilemmas.Finally there&#39;s the biggest gun: Using antitrust <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> to break up big tech companies. Calls for antitrust action have become increasingly loud, most notably in a recent essay in this paper by the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> co-founder Chris Hughes. His statement that the company should be broken up attracted a lot of attention, especially after he called the power held by Mark Zuckerberg, his former college roommate, &#34;un-American.&#34; That had to hurt, even if the blow is likely to be glancing, since antitrust cases are slow-moving and hard to pull off.And yet the idea of using antitrust to rein in these companies got a significant boost recently with the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to allow a lawsuit from consumers aimed at how Apple runs its App Store to proceed in a lower court.Breaking with the more conservative wing of the court in a 5-4 decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion that Apple&#39;s arguments that it wasn&#39;t subject to a lawsuit over its app prices &#34;disregard statutory text and precedent, create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers and furnish monopolistic retailers with a how-to guide for evasion of the antitrust laws.&#34;Apple has and will continue to argue that it is not a monopoly in either hardware and software - which is true. But the case, though narrow, is still a flashing neon sign of change. It centers on rethinking the idea of what a monopoly is with an eye to the power of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">network</span> effect. Even if a company doesn&#39;t completely dominate its sector, if its platform can exercise what amounts to an iron-fisted control over consumers, perhaps it should be considered a monopoly after all.[Technology has made our lives easier. But it also means that your <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> is no longer your own. We&#39;ll examine who is hoarding your <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> - and give you a guide for what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.]Google and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> are good examples, because they hold sway in all kinds of ways that make it hard for other companies to compete and for consumers to escape. Google&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> of the search market allows it to dominate mapping, recommendations, email, video, documents and more, while <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> rules the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> world through its main app along with Instagram and WhatsApp. None of this is good for consumers, except perhaps by the measure of convenience, because the choices they have are limited and never likely to challenge the status quo. In other words, these companies are Apex Predators, too. You don&#39;t have to be as powerful as Bill Gates once was to be just as harmful. The question now is: How do we get consumers on top of the food chain for once?Like other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> companies, The Times <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collects</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">China Snares Tourists&#39; Phones in Surveillance Dragnet by Adding Secret App</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1569</span>
FULL TEXTBEIJING - China has turned its western region of Xinjiang into a police state with few modern parallels, employing a combination of high-tech <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> and enormous manpower to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">monitor</span> and subdue the area&#39;s predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. Now, the digital dragnet is expanding beyond Xinjiang&#39;s residents, ensnaring tourists, traders and other visitors - and digging deep into their smartphones.A team of journalists from The New York Times and other publications examined a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policing</span> app used in the region, getting a rare look inside the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">intrusive</span> technologies that China is deploying in the name of quelling Islamic radicalism and strengthening Communist Party rule in its Far West. The use of the app has not been previously reported.China&#39;s border authorities routinely install the app on smartphones belonging to travelers who enter Xinjiang by land from Central Asia, according to several people interviewed by the journalists who crossed the border recently and requested anonymity to avoid government retaliation. Chinese officials also installed the app on the phone of one of the journalists during a recent border crossing. Visitors were required to turn over their devices to be allowed into Xinjiang.The app gathers <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from phones, including text messages and contacts. It also checks whether devices are carrying pictures, videos, documents and audio files that match any of more than 73,000 items included on a list <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> within the app&#39;s code.Those items include Islamic State publications, recordings of jihadi anthems and images of executions. But they also include material without any connection to Islamic terrorism, an indication of China&#39;s heavy-handed approach to stopping extremist violence. There are scanned pages from an Arabic dictionary, recorded recitations of Quran verses, a photo of the Dalai Lama and even a song by a Japanese band of the earsplitting heavy-metal style known as grindcore.&#34;The Chinese government, both in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> and practice, often conflates peaceful religious activities with terrorism,&#34; Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said. &#34;You can see in Xinjiang, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> is a gateway right: Once you lose your <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> to privacy, you&#39;re going to be afraid of practicing your religion, speaking what&#39;s on your mind or even thinking your thoughts.&#34;The United States has condemned Beijing for the crackdown in Xinjiang, which Chinese officials defend as a nonlethal way of fighting terrorism. The region is home to many of the country&#39;s Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group, and the Chinese government has blamed Islamic extremism and Uighur separatism for deadly attacks on Chinese targets.In the past few years, China has placed hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslims in re-education camps in Xinjiang. For the region&#39;s residents, police checkpoints and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> cameras equipped with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">facial</span> recognition technology have imbued life with a corrosive fear of acting out of turn. With the scanning of phones at the border, the Chinese government is applying similarly invasive monitoring techniques to people who do not even live in Xinjiang or China. Beijing has said that terrorist groups use Central Asian countries as staging grounds for attacks in China. Three people who crossed the Xinjiang land border from Kyrgyzstan in the past year said that as part of a lengthy inspection, Chinese border officials had demanded that visitors unlock and hand over their handsets and computers. On Android devices, officers installed an app called Fengcai (pronounced &#34;FUNG-tsai&#34;), a name that evokes bees <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> pollen.A copy of Fengcai was examined by journalists from The New York Times; the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung; the German broadcaster NDR; The Guardian; and Motherboard, the Vice Media technology site. One of the journalists undertook the border crossing in recent months. Holders of Chinese passports, including members of the majority Han ethnic group, had their phones checked as well, the journalist said.Apple devices were not spared scrutiny. Visitors&#39; iPhones were unlocked and connected via a USB cable to a hand-held device, the journalist said. What the device did could not be determined.The journalists also asked researchers at the Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany and the Open Technology Fund, an initiative funded by the United States government under Radio Free Asia, to analyze the code of the Android app, Fengcai. The Open Technology Fund then requested and funded an assessment of the app by Cure53, a cybersecurity company in Berlin. The app&#39;s simple design makes the inspection process easy for border officers to carry out. After Fengcai is installed on a phone, the researchers found, it gathers all <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> text messages, call records, contacts and calendar entries, as well as <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about the device itself. The app also checks the files on the phone against the list of more than 73,000 items. This list contains only the size of each file and a code that serves as a unique signature. It does not include the files&#39; names or other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that would indicate what they are.But at the journalists&#39; request, researchers at the Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group based at the University of Toronto, obtained <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about roughly 1,400 of the files by comparing their signatures with ones <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> by VirusTotal, a malware-scanning service owned by the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> sibling company Chronicle. Additional files were <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> by Vinny Troia, the founder of the cybersecurity firm NightLion Security, and York Yannikos of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Darmstadt, Germany.Most of the files that the journalists could <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> were related to Islamic terrorism: Islamic State recruitment materials in several languages, books written by jihadi figures, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about how to derail trains and build homemade weapons.Many of the files were more benign. There were audio recordings of Quran verses recited by well-known clerics, the sort of material that many practicing Muslims might have on their phones. There were books about Arabic language and grammar, and a copy of &#34;The Syrian Jihad,&#34; a book about the country&#39;s civil war by the researcher Charles R. Lister.Mr. Lister said he did not know why the Chinese authorities might consider him or his book suspicious. He speculated that it might only be because the word &#34;jihad&#34; was in the title.Other files the app scans for have no link to Islam or Islamic extremism. There are writings by the Dalai Lama, whom China considers a dangerous separatist, and a photograph of him. There is a summary of &#34;The 33 Strategies of War,&#34; a book by the author Robert Greene on applying strategic thinking to everyday life. &#34;It&#39;s a bit of a mystery to me,&#34; Mr. Greene said, when told that his book had been flagged.There is also, puzzlingly, an audio file of a metal song: &#34;Cause and Effect,&#34; by the Japanese band Unholy Grave. The reason for the song&#39;s inclusion was not clear, and an email sent to an address on Unholy Grave&#39;s website was not answered.After Fengcai scans a phone, the app generates a report containing all contacts, text messages and call records, as well as lists of calendar entries and of other apps installed on the device. It sends this <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to a server. Two of the people who recently crossed the Xinjiang border said that before officials returned phones to their owners, they took photos of each owner&#39;s passport next to his or her device, making sure that the app was visible on the screen.This suggests that the authorities have been told to be thorough in scanning visitors&#39; phones, although it was not clear how they were using the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> they acquired as a result. It also could not be determined whether anyone had been detained or monitored because of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> generated by the app. If Fengcai remains on a person&#39;s phone after it is installed, it does not continue scanning the device in the background, the app&#39;s code indicates. Officials in Xinjiang are now gathering oceans of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> information, including DNA and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> about people&#39;s movements. It would not be surprising for the Chinese authorities to want this harvesting of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> to begin at the region&#39;s borders.China&#39;s Ministry of Public Security and the Xinjiang regional government did not respond to faxed requests for comment.Names that appear in Fengcai&#39;s source code suggest that the app was made by a unit of FiberHome, a producer of optical cable and telecom equipment that is partly owned by the Chinese state. The unit, Nanjing FiberHome StarrySky Communication Development Company, says on its website that it offers products to help the police <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> and analyze data, and that it has signed agreements with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> authorities across China. FiberHome and StarrySky did not respond to requests for comment. According to StarrySky&#39;s website, the company offers &#34;cellphone forensic equipment,&#34; which it says can extract, analyze and recover <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from mobile phones. On another page, StarrySky says the purpose of its &#34;smart policing&#34; products is &#34;to let there be not a bad guy in the world who is hard to catch.&#34;Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Berlin.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Will the Census Count All of America?</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 710</span>
FULL TEXTThe Constitution calls for an &#34;actual Enumeration&#34; of each state&#39;s population every 10 years, and since 1790, Congress has enacted <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">legislation</span> to fulfill that mandate. The decennial count, managed at the United States Census Bureau, aims to fulfill that constitutional requirement.Next week, in what promises to be the highest-profile case of this Supreme Court term, the court will consider whether the Trump administration complied with these dictates when it sought to add to the 2020 census a question about whether the respondent is a United States citizen.At the heart of the dispute lies the question: Who gets to be counted?Federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> protects the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> of everyone who responds to the census. But that&#39;s small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census.The 2020 count is no exception. Three federal judges - in New York, California and Maryland - have held trials and ruled that Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who oversees the Census bureau, violated the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> when he ignored available <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> and ordered the agency to move ahead with the citizenship question.As those judges noted, the bureau&#39;s own career scientists and statisticians were kept in the dark about Mr. Ross&#39;s plans, which were devised in the early days of the Trump administration by the president&#39;s former chief strategist Steve Bannon and by Kris Kobach, then the Kansas attorney general and a notorious immigration hard-liner. United States District Judge Jesse Furman, who first struck down the citizenship question in January, said Mr. Ross ran afoul of &#34;a veritable smorgasbord&#34; of rules governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, a cornerstone of federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> that tells the government how to do its job.Judge Furman didn&#39;t hold back. Mr. Ross &#34;failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">record</span> before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices,&#34; he wrote.Mr. Ross has defended the citizenship question by arguing that the Justice Department needs the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to better enforce the Voting Rights <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Act</span> of 1965. Judge Furman rightfully called that rationale &#34;pretextual&#34; - the secretary searched for it after he had decided what he wanted.By the bureau&#39;s own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the &#34;short form&#34; that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6.5 million people - close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn&#39;t pose significant &#34;potential quality and cost disruptions&#34; in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from the American Community Survey, a longer questionnaire sent out annually that already asks such a question.It&#39;s against this backdrop that the Supreme Court will decide whether Mr. Ross followed the procedures set out in federal law. Technical though that inquiry may seem, the justices&#39; decision could have profound consequences. The census today helps determine key aspects of the nation&#39;s representative democracy: how many seats in Congress will be apportioned among the states, and thus in the Electoral College; the distribution of billions of dollars in federal funds; and how state and congressional districts will be drawn in the next redistricting cycle. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> also goes to other uses that are vital to local communities and businesses.Two versions of the 2020 census form -one with the citizenship question and one without - are ready to be printed the moment the Supreme Court rules, most likely at the end of June. Whether the nation gets an accurate and fair count of its residents is now in the justices&#39; hands.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Online and Making Thousands, at Age 4: Meet the Kidfluencers</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1943</span>
FULL TEXTSamia was an influencer before she could talk.Her parents, Adam and LaToya Ali, are influencers themselves and began chronicling Samia&#39;s impending arrival on YouTube and Instagram in 2014, once Ms. Ali learned she was pregnant. &#34;Samia&#39;s birth video is on YouTube, so she&#39;s pretty much been born into <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> media,&#34; Mr. Ali said. Samia is now 4 and has 143,000 followers on Instagram and 203,000 subscribers on YouTube. Her feeds are mostly populated with posts of her posing and playing, but they also feature paid promotions for brands like Crayola and HomeStyle Harvest chicken nuggets. There are instances when &#34;Samia can&#39;t verbatim get the message out,&#34; Mr. Ali, who lives in the Atlanta area, said of the promotional posts. &#34;Sometimes, their talking points are not kid talk, so LaToya would need to appear, or myself, to relay those because those are key deliverables that the brands want.&#34; Welcome to the world of kidfluencers. Brands have flocked to influencers - individuals, famous or not, with large followings on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> - for years, hoping their online popularity will prompt their fans to buy the products they vouch for. Then child influencers started appearing on their parents&#39; profiles, a surreal but seemingly harmless offshoot of this phenomenon. Now, advertisers like Walmart, Staples and Mattel are bankrolling lucrative endorsements deals for toddlers and tweens with large followings and their own verified profiles on YouTube and Instagram. As a result, children too young to make their own accounts on the platforms are being turned into tastemakers. Instagram, owned by Facebook, and YouTube, which is part of Google, are designed for adults in large part because of a federal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> that protects children under 13. Bios for many of the younger influencers on Instagram note that the pages are &#34;run by parents,&#34; and YouTube channels are presumably registered to their guardians.Because they say their platforms are 13-and-older zones, technology companies do not have to comply with federal rules that limit targeted <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">advertising</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> collection. But Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said the companies had no incentive to keep children off the sites. And as TV ratings continue to fall and children spend more time online, advertisers are spending more money to reach them there. &#34;The fact that brands are using actual children as influencers is a very clear sign that they&#39;re targeting children that they know are on these platforms,&#34; Mr. Golin said. That can mean big money for the families of kidfluencers. Kyler Fisher, the father of 2-year-old identical twins who have more than two million followers on Instagram, said a sponsored post on the girls&#39; account could fetch between $10,000 and $20,000. The twins, Taytum and Oakley, have promoted car seats and Carnival Cruise Lines on Instagram. They are also central to the success of their parents&#39; YouTube channel, Kyler &amp;amp;amp; Mad, which has about three million subscribers. Promotions on the family YouTube channel can draw $25,000 to $50,000.Fans are so interested in the family that their third child, due the first week of March, already has 112,000 Instagram followers. &#34;My kids complete the package, man,&#34; Mr. Fisher said. &#34;If we didn&#39;t have the girls, I can&#39;t imagine being as far as we are.&#34;Another parent shared the prices commanded by the parent&#39;s child on the condition of anonymity, citing concern that the disclosures could <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">harm</span> negotiations with brands. The parent said brands might pay $10,000 to $15,000 for a promotional Instagram post while a sponsored YouTube video might earn $45,000. A 30- to 90-second shout-out in a longer video can cost advertisers between $15,000 and $25,000. Brands are also pursuing children with smaller followings. The toy company Melissa &amp;amp;amp; Doug emailed parents about a six-week influencer campaign last summer, offering payments and free toys for weekly Instagram posts of their children &#34;having fun with the toys!&#34; The company said it would pay $10 per 1,000 followers for individual Instagram posts and $5 per 1,000 followers for Instagram Story posts. The rise of this kind of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">advertising</span> has raised questions involving fair compensation, oversight and work permits, especially since child labor guidelines vary by state.Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokeswoman, said that the site didn&#39;t allow anyone under 13 to make or own accounts and that it worked &#34;closely with experts, nonprofit organizations and others in our industry to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> families using our services.&#34; YouTube came under fire last month after lewd comments by pedophiles were discovered on innocent videos of children; the company has since said it will suspend comments on most videos of minors. Some channels that can &#34;demonstrate a low <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> of predatory behavior&#34; will keep comments but require moderators, the company said. It remains to be seen if disabling comments will hurt the kind of connections kidfluencers try to establish with their fans. Sravanthi Dev, a spokeswoman for Instagram, said that while the platform prohibited users 12 and under, their parents or representatives could create profiles for them &#34;as long as it is clear in the bio <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> that the account is run by the parent or representative.&#34; Michelle Foley&#39;s 6-year-old daughter, Ava, and her best friend, Everleigh, also 6, have more than a million followers on their shared Instagram and YouTube accounts. YouTube&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">analytics</span> say Ava and Everleigh&#39;s viewers are largely between the ages of 25 and 44, Ms. Foley said, but she said she thought the core audience was between 8 and 18. &#34;When we go out, parents never know who we are, but kids do,&#34; Ms. Foley said. Alex Chavez-Munoz, a founder of Viral Talent, which works with child influencers, also disputed the data.&#34;When you see the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">analytics</span> of a kidfluencer channel, the dominant audience is 25- to 34-year-old women,&#34; Mr. Chavez-Munoz said. &#34;That&#39;s obviously not the case. The case is that the child is watching it on their parents&#39; device.&#34;In December, a 9-year-old kidfluencer known as Txunamy shared a photo on Instagram and asked her more than two million followers to comment on it and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> their ages. Thousands of replies flooded in: 9, 10, 11 years old.Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, found more than 3,100 Instagram influencers, from a sample of 1.2 million accounts, who are likely under 13 based on terms in their bios like &#34;managed by mom.&#34; (Instagram has more than a billion users.) Each account had at least 1,000 followers. On YouTube, the much bigger kid influencer destination, there are toy accounts like Ryan ToysReview, whose young star earned $22 million in a year, according to Forbes. But children, under their parents&#39; watch, are also building followings on YouTube and Instagram as gamers, video bloggers, fashionistas, mischievous toddlers and personalities who anchor family channels, which are often a cross between reality TV, pranks and random skits. YouTube accounts can also bring in serious ad dollars without brand deals, which are shared with the site.Everleigh&#39;s grandmother, whom Ms. Foley met when they worked together, came up with the idea of making an Instagram account for the girls when they were 10 months old, calling them &#34;besties&#34; and dressing them in matching outfits. The girls went &#34;viral&#34; eight months later after the account helped them land a modeling campaign for the Kardashian Kids line, Ms. Foley said. At that point, &#34;we were like, &#39;We should start a YouTube,&#39; but they couldn&#39;t talk,&#34; she said. &#34;So then we kind of waited for them to start talking.&#34;The girls also have their own separate Instagram accounts. Everleigh&#39;s sponsored posts have included promotions for toys (&#34;I&#39;m excited to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> that the new PAW Patrol Mighty Pups line is available exclusively at Walmart!&#34;) and Disney dolls (&#34;Everleigh is in LOVE with her Fancy Nancy dolls!&#34;). The girls have made celebrities out of the rest of their families. Ava&#39;s 1-year-old brother has 148,000 Instagram followers, and Everleigh&#39;s newborn sister has a million. Recently, Everleigh started a YouTube channel, Everleigh Opens Toys, and Ava is interested in making one, too, Ms. Foley said.&#34;If it wasn&#39;t for Everleigh and Ava, I would not have what I have today,&#34; she said. Brands want to team up with children for the same reasons they want to work with older <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">social</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> personalities - their follower counts, the ability to post more quickly than traditional ad agencies, the way the posts feel like recommendations from a friend. But advocates say these techniques can deceive children, who are in the early stages of understanding and recognizing advertisements. Children&#39;s television, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, has rules that separate ads from content and limit product placement and promotions by a program&#39;s host or characters. The internet doesn&#39;t. YouTube has its own guidelines for children&#39;s advertising, but they are often hard to police. For example, the YouTube Kids app, designed for children 12 and under, is not supposed to contain sponsored content, but The New York Times found several paid advertorial videos from influencers there for companies like Walmart, Dreamworks and Claire&#39;s. (YouTube removed the videos after The Times asked about them.)&#34;It is very manipulative of young children,&#34; said Kathryn Montgomery, a professor emerita at American University&#39;s School of Communications. &#34;With this form of promotion and advertising, there is a purposeful blurring of those lines.&#34;Ava and Everleigh&#39;s YouTube channel peppers sponsored videos among dance battles and hangouts with other influencers. Ms. Foley said the family could get 10 email requests a day from brands. The girls posted a 10-minute sponsored video for Mattel in November titled &#34;First Sleepover Opening Giant Presents!&#34; An adult asked the children, clad in matching pajamas, about their holiday wish list, which was &#34;Barbie everything!&#34; They appeared to sleep, then woke up, squealing, to wrapped Barbie merchandise. Mattel declined to comment on its child influencer strategy.In an advertorial video for Staples, Txunamy declared her excitement about back-to-school shopping at the chain, then showcased her &#34;haul.&#34;&#34;Whenever we work with younger influencers, all contracts and negotiations are conducted through their parents or talent agencies directly representing them,&#34; said Meghan McCarrick, a spokeswoman for Staples.Social <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">media</span> stars aren&#39;t typically considered actors under the law. In California, a portion of child actors&#39; earnings are set aside in a trust based on the decades-old Coogan Law, named for a former child star whose parents spent all his money by the time he turned 21. Similar trusts are required by New York, Louisiana and New Mexico. For kidfluencers, it&amp;amp;#39;s usually a voluntary decision by parents to create these accounts. Several families said they had established the accounts after working on traditional TV shows or national commercials. As for the children, it can be tough for them to understand how much of a fuss they&#39;re creating. Samia&#39;s father, Mr. Ali, said, &#34;She doesn&#39;t have a concept of viral or &#39;views,&#39; so it&#39;s almost like, for her, walking into an experiment to learn something - it&#39;s more of us giving her a task or assignment, where she has something to conquer.&#34;He added, &#34;We&#39;ll know when she gets a sense of her following and let her know what this all means.&#34;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Europe&#39;s Privacy Law Hasn&#39;t Shown Its Teeth, Frustrating Advocates</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1524</span>
Nearly two years in, there has been little enforcement of the General <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Protection Regulation, once seen as ushering in a new era.LONDON - When Europe enacted the world&#39;s toughest online <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> nearly two years ago, it was heralded as a model to crack down on the invasive, data-hungry practices of the world&#39;s largest technology companies.Now, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> is struggling to fulfill its promise.Europe&#39;s rules have been a victim of a lack of enforcement, poor funding, limited staff resources and stalling tactics by the tech companies, according to budget and staffing figures and interviews with government officials. Even some of the law&#39;s biggest supporters are frustrated with how it has worked.In addition, the response to Covid-19 is raising new questions about the role of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> safeguards, as digital tools for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> health and location information, once viewed warily by the European authorities, are now crucial parts of containment strategies.The law, known as the General <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., created new limits on how companies can <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> without <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">user</span> consent. It gave governments broad authority to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company&#39;s global revenue, or to force changes to its data-collection practices. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> served as a model for new <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> rules in Brazil, Japan, India and elsewhere.But since the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> was enacted, in May 2018, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> has been the only giant tech company to be penalized - a fine of 50 million euros, worth roughly $54 million today, or about one-tenth of what <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> generates in sales each day. No major fines or penalties have been announced against Facebook, Amazon or Twitter.The inaction is creating tension within European governments, as some leaders call for speedier enforcement and broader changes. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Privacy</span> groups and smaller tech companies complain that companies like <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> are avoiding tough oversight. At the same time, the public&#39;s experience with the G.D.P.R. has been a frustrating number of pop-up <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">consent</span> windows to click through when visiting a website.Europe&#39;s challenges <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> undermining efforts elsewhere in the world to create tougher <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> rules, said Johnny Ryan, a leading campaigner for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulation. He said American officials had told him that Europe&#39;s problems with putting G.D.P.R. into effect were a reason not to create federal standards in the United States.&#34;If you don&#39;t have strong, robust enforcement and investment, this <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> is a fantasy,&#34; said Mr. Ryan, the chief <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> officer at Brave, which makes an internet browser with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> protections to limit <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">tracking</span> and advertising. &#34;We have failed to realize the potential of G.D.P.R. thus far.&#34;Supporters acknowledge that the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> has had growing pains and that cases have taken longer as new procedures are put in place. But they say it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> has increased awareness about <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and forced many companies, including <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and Google, to adopt new policies to comply. California and New York have adopted similar <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws.The biggest test of the G.D.P.R. thus far will come in the months ahead, supporters argue, when a batch of rulings involving big technology companies are expected. Twitter is expected to be one of the first to be penalized, in an Irish case related to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> breaches. WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service, faces possible penalties for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">sharing</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> with other <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> services.&#34;The G.D.P.R. is a long-term project,&#34; said Eduardo Ustaran, who leads the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> practice at Hogan Lovells International, a London <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> firm that represents many large companies. &#34;The past couple of years barely give us a glimpse of whether this project will be successful.&#34;Facebook said in a statement that it was committed to the principles of the G.D.P.R., which have resulted in making &#34;our policies clearer, our <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">delete</span> their information.&#34;Amazon said that as a result of the law, it had introduced a new <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> help page where customers can see more <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> the company collects. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and Twitter declined to comment.Many critics said that even if the companies were penalized, the actions had taken too long, leaving regulators at <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">risk</span> of fighting yesterday&#39;s battles. The cases could drag for several more years as a result of court appeals. And with limited financial resources, critics argue, the authorities are inclined to be overly cautious and avoid more complex cases.Adding to the challenges is the coronavirus pandemic, which has altered the debate about how to build mobile apps and other technologies. Techniques that were once seen as <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">intrusive</span> in Europe, like <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collecting</span> location and health data, are part of government plans to contain the virus.The G.D.P.R. provides &#34;legal grounds to enable the employers and the competent public health authorities to process <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> in the context of epidemics, without the need to obtain the consent&#34; of individuals, the European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Protection Board, which helps coordinate enforcement of the law, said in a recent statement. The European Commission delayed until June the release of a full review of the G.D.P.R. as a result of the virus.Frustrated by the lack of progress, Mr. Ryan spent several weeks examining budget and staffing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from 28 European countries. Mr. Ryan, who lives in Ireland and filed a complaint with regulators there against <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> over its ad-targeting practices, found that all but three - Germany, Britain and Italy - had <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection agencies with annual budgets of less than (EURO)25 million.In his report, to be published this week, Mr. Ryan found that most countries had only a handful of investigators with industrial expertise dedicated to reviewing technology industry cases. He is filing a complaint with the European Union asking it to penalize countries that do not give <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection agencies enough resources.Regulators acknowledge the problem and have called for more money. In a February survey of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulators in 30 European countries, 21 responded that &#34;resources are not enough&#34; to fulfill their responsibilities. Luxembourg, which is responsible for regulating Amazon, had a budget of roughly (EURO)5.7 million last year, worth about $6.2 million, or roughly Amazon&#39;s sales over 10 minutes.&#34;We have a lack of enforcement,&#34; said Ulrich Kelber, the chairman of Germany&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection authority, which has the highest budget in the European Union, at roughly (EURO)85 million when including regional agencies. &#34;Most of the European governments don&#39;t give enough resources to the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection authorities.&#34;He called for a more centralized approach, in which countries pool resources and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> responsibilities for investigating the biggest companies. Currently, each country is responsible for regulating companies that have their European headquarters within its borders.At the center of the dispute is Ireland, which has outsize influence over the law&#39;s enforcement because Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter are all based there. The country is responsible for leading more investigations, 127, than any other country in Europe, according to Brave. Yet in nearly two years, it has not issued a single G.D.P.R. penalty.Ireland&#39;s budget of (EURO)16.9 million ranks sixth among <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection agencies in Europe. Last year, Ireland&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection regulator sought a budget increase of (EURO)5.9 million. It got a third of that amount.Helen Dixon, the chair of Ireland&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection agency, said she was frustrated by the budget restrictions but defended the work of her office. More than 140 people work in her office, compared with 27 in 2017. She graded Ireland&#39;s performance an &#34;A for effort&#34; but a &#34;C-plus/B-minus in terms of output.&#34;Ms. Dixon said rulings involving Twitter, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> and others were coming. But she said her office had been overwhelmed by complaints filed by advocates like Mr. Ryan that called for sweeping, resource-intensive investigations of entire industries like digital advertising. Under the law, regulators must respond to every complaint filed - more than 12,000 in Ireland since 2018.Companies like <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> asked a slew of procedural legal questions that must be responded to before cases can advance, Ms. Dixon said. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> stalled regulators by not immediately declaring where its European headquarters would be.Ms. Dixon said many people wrongly assumed that the G.D.P.R. would result in a swift and wholesale shake-up of data-collection practices of the largest tech companies.&#34;There will be fines, there is no doubt about that,&#34; she said, but the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> &#34;doesn&#39;t allow for taking on an entire sector.&#34;Regulators have other leverage beyond investigations, Ms. Dixon said. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Facebook</span> delayed the release of its dating app, she explained, after the Irish authorities raised questions about its <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> collection.&#34;There are lots of different ways to go about creating a positive effect,&#34; she said. &#34;Not all of them cater around fines and the superficial commentary we sometimes see.&#34;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Report tells of extensive cyberattack lasting years;Security experts believe a nation-state took aim at countries and companies</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1112</span>
FULL TEXTA massive cyberattack that lasted up to five years infiltrated computers and stole <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from the United Nations and a wide range of governments and U.S. corporations, according to a report released on Wednesday by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> experts in the United States.The U.S. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> company McAfee called the assault a highly sophisticated cyberattack that appeared to have been operated by a government body. But McAfee, which was recently acquired by Intel, declined to say which country it believed was behind the attack.&#39;&#39;We&#39;re not pointing fingers at anyone, but we believe it was a nation-state,&#39;&#39; Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee&#39;s vice president of threat research and the lead author of the report, said by telephone on Wednesday.Organizations in the United States constituted 49 of the 72 targets, McAfee said, while governments, companies and organizations in Britain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan also were attacked multiple times.&#39;&#39;After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,&#39;&#39; Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the 14-page report.Among the few targets mentioned by name in the report are the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The report comes after a series of high-profile cyberattacks aimed at the International Monetary Fund, Sony and Lockheed Martin, the United States&#39; largest military contractor.McAfee said it released the report to coincide with the start of the Black Hat technical <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> conference in Las Vegas. Briefings at the conference, an annual gathering of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> professionals, were scheduled to be delivered Wednesday and Thursday.The company said it had alerted victims of the attacks and had also informed <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> enforcement agencies, which were investigating the intrusions.However, Mark Adams, a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee, said, &#39;&#39;We are unaware of the alleged attempt to compromise our <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> claimed by McAfee. If true, such allegations would of course be disturbing.&#39;&#39;He added, &#39;&#39;The I.O.C. is transparent in its operations and has no secrets that would compromise either our operations or our reputation.&#39;&#39;Spokesmen for the United Nations and the World Anti-Doping Agency could not be reached for comment.In its report, McAfee said it learned of the hacking campaign last March, when it discovered logs of attacks while reviewing the contents of a server it had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breaches</span> at defense companies.It dubbed the attacks &#39;&#39;Operation Shady RAT&#39;&#39; - RAT stands for &#39;&#39;remote <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> tool,&#39;&#39; a type of software used to gain <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to computer networks.The earliest <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">breaches</span> dated from mid-2006, though McAfee said there might have been other intrusions still undetected. The duration of the attacks ranged from a month to what McAfee said was a sustained 28-month <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">attack</span> against the Olympic committee of an unidentified Asian nation.What was done with the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> &#39;&#39;is still largely an open question,&#39;&#39; Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the report. &#39;&#39;However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team&#39;s playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.&#39;&#39;Asked why McAfee decided not to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identify</span> most of the corporations that were attacked in &#39;&#39;Operation Shady RAT,&#39;&#39; the company said on Wednesday that most corporations were worried about being <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">identified</span> and alarming shareholders or customers.Cyberattacks have heightened overall concerns among government officials and corporate executives, who are being warned about the sophistication of the attacks and the ability of hackers to gain <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to sensitive corporate and military secrets, including intellectual property.In some attacks, the culprits are believed to be professional hackers engaged in disrupting an organization&#39;s operations for the sheer pleasure of it, or in a search for revenge.In mid-May, the administration of President Barack Obama proposed creating international computer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. The strategy called for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with standards aimed at preventing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">theft</span> of private <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> and ensuring Internet freedom.Obama administration officials said privately at the time that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">theft</span> and enacting stricter <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">protect</span> computer users&#39; privacy.There are also growing concerns that some cyberattacks are being carried out by governments, particularly after <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> said last year that Chinese hackers had stolen some of the company&#39;s source code. Many <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> experts say the Chinese government has built up a sophisticated cyberwarfare unit and that the government may be teaming up with professional hackers.In February, a Canadian cabinet minister said that hackers, perhaps from China, had compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell B. Day, the president of the Treasury Board, called the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">attack</span> a &#39;&#39;significant one&#39;&#39; that went after financial records.Also in February, McAfee released a report saying that at least five multinational oil and gas companies had suffered computer <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">network</span> attacks by a group of hackers based in China.Beijing has strongly denied any role in cyberattacks and insisted it has been a frequent victim of cyberattacks. On Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment about allegations of Chinese links to cyberattacks following the McAfee report.But last month, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Hong Lei, said, &#39;&#39;The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.&#39;&#39;He added, &#39;&#39;Hacking is an international issue, with which China also falls victim. China is willing to conduct international cooperation in this regard. We are dissatisfied with some people&#39;s irresponsible remarks that link hacker attacks with the Chinese government.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">&#39;Telepsychiatry&#39; trips on hurdle of who will pay;Insurance companies are reluctant to support therapy conducted online</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 857</span>
FULL TEXTSee a therapist without leaving your home?In an article in The American Journal of Psychiatry, Dr. Thomas F. Dwyer, a Massachusetts psychiatrist, says he has practiced &#39;&#39;telepsychiatry,&#39;&#39; via video teleconferencing, for five years. Its &#39;&#39;adoption by psychiatrists and patients,&#39;&#39; he predicts, &#39;&#39;will proceed quickly if the organizers cope with the irrational responses of some users.&#39;&#39;But wait: That article appeared almost 40 years ago. It told how microwave television signals had been used to connect a satellite clinic to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Today, even with the rise of the Internet, virtual therapy has not been widely adopted. But several start-up companies are trying to make Dr. Dwyer&#39;s decades-old vision a workaday reality.Therapy delivered over the Internet, says Lynn Bufka, a psychologist and staff member of the American Psychological Association, &#39;&#39;may open <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to those who might be reluctant to go to an office or to those who might be physically or psychologically unable to.&#39;&#39;Proponents of Internet-based therapy point to some research suggesting that it is effective for certain kinds of conditions, like depression and anxiety. Reporting in The Lancet in 2009, a team of researchers found that cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered remotely to depressed patients in Britain had continued to show benefits eight months later.But providers promoting online therapy must contend with uneven or absent support from insurance companies and Medicare and Medicaid, the U.S. government health care programs. Most U.S. states do not require insurers to pay for &#39;&#39;telehealth&#39;&#39; services - that is, services not delivered in person. And any reimbursements can be less substantial than for treatment in person. Medicare offers reimbursement only if providers are very scarce, as in rural areas.One company that is trying to match patients to therapists online is Cope Today, based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Tania S. Malik, its chief executive, said that the company, which started work in 2010, had worked with the North Carolina National Guard for a pilot test of its service. It has since opened its service to individuals whom it attracts primarily with search ads that are keyed to phrases like &#39;&#39;online counseling&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;treating anxiety.&#39;&#39;Cope Today lets clients view a list of therapists and their availability for consultation via video, phone or online chat. It provides the first 10 minutes of a session free, then charges $35 for 15-minute increments. Ms. Malik says the average length of a consultation is 43 minutes. She declined to say what percentage of clients return for further sessions.It is hard to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">sell</span> the service to individuals who must pay for therapy themselves, Ms. Malik says. But she hopes to sign up employers who will pay for the service. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think we could be a success on a strict direct-to-consumer business, operating without reimbursement from insurance companies,&#39;&#39; she says.Another company offering online therapy, HealthLinkNow, in Sacramento, California, has decided to avoid the direct-to-consumer route, at least for now. The company, which started its service in May, is trying to sign up institutional clients, like hospital emergency rooms or large employers, rather than individuals going online at home.Barbara Johnston, the chief executive of HealthLinkNow, says: &#39;&#39;I think you&#39;re going to see larger companies provide rooms in which employees can seek telemedicine services, including mental health services. That way, the employee won&#39;t lose a half or a whole day of work for a consult.&#39;&#39;Because a range of health services would be provided in the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> of that room, no stigma should attach to a patient who goes in for a private e-therapy session. &#39;&#39;No one will know,&#39;&#39; Ms. Johnston says.One disadvantage of online therapy through teleconferencing is that &#39;&#39;it can be hard to &#39;read&#39; each other&#39;s cues&#39;&#39; that are not visible, like body language, according to Ms. Bufka.&#39;&#39;Humor can misfire, and some people may really benefit from having the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> relationship of therapy,&#39;&#39; she says.Carolyn L. Turvey, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa and the vice chairwoman of the mental health group of the American Telemedicine Association, says her group has concerns about how prepared online therapists might be for a crisis.When patients came to a clinic in the earliest days of telepsychiatry, in the 1960s, someone was on hand who was trained to follow an emergency protocol. But homes and offices are &#39;&#39;clinically unsupervised settings,&#39;&#39; Ms. Turvey says. She recommends that the therapist <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> emergency contact <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> at the first e-consultation.Patients with a strong desire for anonymity might log off, however, before providing such data. Ms. Malik, of Cope Today, says the therapists she represents, 90 percent of whom have private practices in traditional offices, do not <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> contact <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> from their online patients. &#39;&#39;If you&#39;re counseling and it escalates, we would call 911,&#39;&#39; she says.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">E.U. panel expected to facilitate spread of cloud computing;Its report will highlight advantages in terms of innovation and efficiency</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1438</span>
FULL TEXTThe European Commission&#39;s panel on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> is expected on Monday to endorse the concept of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> as legal under the Continent&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> and to recommend for the first time that large companies and organizations police themselves to assure that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> kept in remote locations is protected.The panel, known as the Article 29 Working Party, is expected to make the recommendation as part of its long-awaited guidelines on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> computing, which have the potential, some industry experts say, to allay concerns over <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and pave the way for wider adoption of the remote-computing services that are more common in the United States.The report will highlight the advantages of using <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> to encourage innovation and economic efficiency, said a person with knowledge of the recommendations, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak for the group. This would reflect a new, more practical approach by European officials to remote computing&#39;s role in the broader economy.The recommendations are expected to guide decisions on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> by regulators in the 27 E.U. countries. The sellers of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services are hoping the new guidelines will improve their image in Europe, where concerns about <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and fears that business secrets could be stolen in U.S.-based <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> centers have discouraged sales.According to Gartner, the research firm, European sales of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> trail those in the United States by at least two years, in part because of these concerns.&#39;&#39;I am hoping that the recommendations will allow people to take advantage of the technology that is out there in a controlled way,&#39;&#39; said David Gibson, vice president in charge of strategy at Varonis Systems, a seller, based in New York, of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> software to businesses and institutions. &#39;&#39;Some of the regulations being discussed in Europe are actually pretty progressive and could give the business model a push forward there, as well as in the States.&#39;&#39;Cloud <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> refers to the delivery of services over the Internet rather than through the use of software. There are various types of services and various types of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> providers, both public and private. The sales of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services are rising about 24 percent each year, according to International <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Corp., or about four times as fast as the rate of technology spending over all.Public <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services - offered by Amazon.com, Salesforce.com and Savvis, among other companies - amounted to $28 billion worldwide in 2011, I.D.C. says.The North American market accounting for $17.4 billion, or 62 percent, of sales, while Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for about $7 billion, according to I.D.C.Companies using the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> can save money because they do not have to buy or house servers to deliver the services or store data. Users of the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> typically submit <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> to gain <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">access</span> to their services and data.European interest in the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> appears to be increasing, despite the euro currency crisis and economic downturn, industry executives said.Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Bayerische Motoren Werke and Burberry, among other companies, are all using the cloud-based customer relations management services of Salesforce.com, which in May said it had to hire 750 employees in Europe this year to meet demand from its 20,000 clients on the Continent.In June, Amazon Web Services, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services arm of the U.S. online retailer, made a presentation to several hundred potential customers at an IMAX movie theater on Alexanderplatz in Berlin. &#39;&#39;The room was packed, and from what I can tell, the interest in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> is growing,&#39;&#39; said Andy Jassy, the Amazon Web Services vice president in charge of the division, who made the presentation. &#39;&#39;In difficult economic times, more companies are looking to the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> to save money.&#39;&#39;Some governments in Europe are also beginning to use <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services to cut costs. The borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in England is a customer of Salesforce.com. In Belgium, the national government is creating its own <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> to consolidate government services, said Georges Ataya, a professor of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> technology management at Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. European national governments - which are typically required by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> to process <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> within their own borders - are either buying domestic <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services or setting up their own private clouds to cut technology costs, Mr. Ataya said.&#39;&#39;I think, over time, there is no question that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services are going to take hold in Europe as they have in the United States,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ataya said.The guidelines are unlikely to harmonize in a significant way the patchwork of national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> that govern <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> in Europe, which has tended to reduce the appeal of remote <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> services on the Continent.Britain and Scandinavian countries tend to be more permissive than other European nations about the ways <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> can be <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">processed</span> in clouds, whereas Spain and France impose tough requirements, like requiring <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> service sellers to know at all times where <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> is being kept, said Jörg-Alexander Paul, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> lawyer at the firm Bird &amp;amp; Bird in Frankfurt. Germany has strict <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> on handling <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> data, Mr. Paul said, but its enforcement is relatively lax.The guidelines expected to be introduced Monday are nonbinding. Regulators in E.U. countries are required to give them &#39;&#39;utmost consideration&#39;&#39; in drafting national policies, but have the discretion to interpret the guidelines as they see fit.Still, the guidelines are likely to influence many E.U. nations in their treatment of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> and privacy, particularly the recommendation that regulators accept third-party audits paid for by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> service companies as proof that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> is being handled, even in non-E.U. countries, under E.U. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> laws. Previously, some E.U. regulators had been reluctant to accept the audits.While the report gives greater support to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> than ever before, the list of recommendations - about 30 pages long - from the panel, which is made up of the Union&#39;s 27 national <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulators, also attempts to establish <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> requirements for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> service sellers that could make remote <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> more expensive in Europe.One recommendation would require a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services seller to inform clients exactly where their <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> are being physically <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">stored</span> at any time of day. Another would require sellers to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">delete</span> all <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">computing</span> centers when retaining the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> is no longer necessary. A third may compel <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> service companies to disclose to clients the subcontractors they plan to use to process data.The first two requirements, while perhaps providing greater <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">security</span> to European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> users, could also add complexity and cost to managing <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> in clouds. The third recommendation, if aggressively enforced by E.U. regulators, could undermine large sellers of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services by disclosing to clients a list of potential lower-cost rivals. Some sellers, like Microsoft, have already published a list of 100 subcontractors the company uses to provide <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> services under the Microsoft brand.For transfers of European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> to the United States, the report advises European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> service customers to demand the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection safeguards of the so-called European model contract, a legal agreement that imposes regular reporting and auditing requirements on <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">cloud</span> operators to prove that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> are being handled according to E.U. law. The model contract would supplement the Safe Harbor Agreement, a 12-year-old pact between the United States and European Union that has set out mutual <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> standards for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">storage</span> and transfers.Some European regulators view enforcement of Safe Harbor guarantees, which are overseen by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as insufficient.Some analysts were not convinced that the recommendations will overcome lingering unease of European companies reluctant to store <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> in U.S.-based clouds, where sensitive <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about customers or business practices can theoretically be subject to government <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">surveillance</span> under the Patriot Act.&#39;&#39;There is a fair amount of misunderstanding and downright mistrust of the Patriot <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Act</span> amongst E.U. customers,&#39;&#39; said Chenxi Wang, an analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco. &#39;&#39;A lot of that is emotional reaction versus sound legal judgments.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Google faces new scrutiny in Europe on data capture;&#39;Mistake&#39; claim doubted after engineer reportedly said activity was intended</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 1348</span>
FULL TEXTPrivacy regulators in Britain, Germany and France said Wednesday that they might reopen or expand their investigations into Google&#39;s illegal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> for its Street View service after a programmer reportedly contradicted the company&#39;s explanation that it had been done by mistake.The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">disclosure</span> by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> in 2010 that it had illegally <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> - including e-mails, photos, Web histories and passwords - from Wi-Fi routers around the world was first uncovered in Germany and led to a series of inquiries by <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulators in Europe and around the world.All of those reviews except two in Germany, one regulatory and one criminal, were settled after <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> apologized and attributed the illegal activity to an error by the programmer.But last week in the United States, a new report on the activity by the Federal Communications Commission showed that the programmer, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> engineer who lives in Palo Alto, California, told a superior in 2007 and 2008 that his software would also <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> from unencrypted Wi-Fi routers as Street View recording vehicles passed by, and that seven engineers who worked on the code were in the position to know what was going on.The report also said the engineer had clearly spelled out his intentions in his initial proposal. Managers of the Street View project said they had never read it.In Germany, where reviews by a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulator and the Hamburg State prosecutor&#39;s office are continuing, the new <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> will influence the course of both inquiries, said Johannes Caspar, the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection commissioner for Hamburg, whose investigation first brought Google&#39;s illegal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of Internet <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> to light.&#39;&#39;Of course this will have a big impact,&#39;&#39; Mr. Caspar said. &#39;&#39;This is apparently a totally different situation than what we thought initially. We had been told that it was a simple mistake, as the company had told us. But now, we are <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">learning</span> that this wasn&#39;t a mistake and that people within the company knew this <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> was being collected. That puts it in a totally different light.&#39;&#39;Peter Schaar, the German federal commissioner for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection and freedom of information, is also following the latest developments in the case with interest, a spokeswoman said.A spokesman in Hamburg for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> said the company would have no comment to add to remarks made last week, when the Federal Communications Commission said in its report that it had found no wrongdoing.&#39;&#39;While we disagree with some of the statements made in the document,&#39;&#39; the company said, referring to the report, &#39;&#39;we agree with the F.C.C.&#39;s conclusion that we did not break the law. We hope that we can now put this matter behind us.&#39;&#39;The French <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulator, the Commission Nationale de l&#39;Informatique et des Libertés, said Wednesday that it would also review the F.C.C. report and consider its options.C.N.I.L., as the French regulator is known, is leading a European review of Google&#39;s new global <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> policy, which was announced in January and combines <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> from several <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> services. C.N.I.L. is analyzing Google&#39;s responses to 69 questions that the French regulator sent the company this year.A person with knowledge of the review, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the French agency would most likely have new questions about Google&#39;s <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of Wi-Fi data.In Britain, Greg Jones, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office, said it would review the F.C.C. report to determine whether further action was warranted in Britain. In 2010, the British regulator accepted the apology from <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> and asked it to destroy the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collected</span> in Britain.&#39;&#39;We will study the Federal Communications Commission&#39;s report and consider what further action, if any, needs to be taken,&#39;&#39; Mr. Jones said.The European Union&#39;s top <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> panel, the Article 29 Group, which advises the European Commission, will discuss Google&#39;s illegal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> as part of Street View, a technology featured in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> Maps and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> Earth that gives users a view of the streets they are navigating, and what response to take.Jacob Kohnstamm, chairman of the European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> panel and of the Dutch <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Protection Authority, said European officials were disappointed by the revelations. Many regulators, he said, feel misled by Google, whose executives in 2010 had reassured European lawmakers, often in <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> appearances, that the illegal <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> was unintentional.Mr. Kohnstamm said the new disclosures would be a topic of discussion among European regulators attending a three-day convention that begins on Wednesday in Luxembourg.&#39;&#39;We will certainly discuss the matter,&#39;&#39; he said during an interview. &#39;&#39;My first reaction is, this is a bloody shame.&#39;&#39;Google&#39;s global <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> counsel, Peter Fleischer, spoke in 2010 at a hearing in the Netherlands on the Wi-Fi taping activity, Mr. Kohnstamm said.&#39;&#39;At this hearing, Peter Fleischer made it pretty clear in his oral statement and in writing that it was the mistake of one single guy working at <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> who had made a stupid mistake,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kohnstamm said. &#39;&#39;But apparently, it wasn&#39;t a mistake at all.&#39;&#39;Mr. Kohnstamm said that European regulators would explore legal options to make <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> accountable for its actions but that their options were limited. In the case of the Netherlands, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> destroyed the Dutch <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> it had collected, as requested, and regulators there will not reopen the case, he said.&#39;&#39;I am not quite sure yet what we do legally,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;That depends on what the individual <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection authorities decide to do. But I think it is time for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection authorities around the world to work together to hold the company accountable.&#39;&#39;He added: &#39;&#39;Having told <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection authorities around the globe that the taping was a mistake, and now apparently that it was a deliberate action, is disappointing. In a political sense, that would be considered contempt of Parliament and would mean the end of the career for the person responsible.&#39;&#39;The unauthorized <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of Internet payload data, which the Federal Communications Commission determined was not illegal in the United States, is a violation of European law, Mr. Kohnstamm said.Enforcement of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> in Europe is done on a national level, though a proposed revision to the European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Data</span> Protection Directive, which is not expected to be completed until 2013 at the earliest, would give national regulators the power to sanction violators up to 2 percent of annual sales. Based on Google&#39;s 2011 results, such a fine would amount to $758 million.Under existing law, European <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> regulators can levy only limited fines on global technology companies, even in egregious cases. The French regulator, C.N.I.L., fined <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> (EURO)100,000, or about $131,000 at current exchange rates, for its Wi-Fi <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> in France. German <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> empowers the Hamburg regulator to levy fines of as much as (EURO)500,000 in cases where there is willful intent to violate the law, or (EURO)150,000 in cases of negligence.The British regulator has the power to levy a fine of as much as £500,000, or about $809,000, in cases where violations of British <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> protection <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> by a company or individual cause &#39;&#39;substantial&#39;&#39; damage and distress. But the agency must prove that those responsible knew they were breaking British law.Many European regulators that have already settled with <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> will have a hard time legally reopening their cases, said Mr. Caspar, the Hamburg regulator.Even the German criminal investigation could be thwarted by jurisdictional obstacles. The <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> engineer lives in the United States, possibly complicating efforts by German prosecutors to question him. According to the F.C.C. report, he invoked his constitutional <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> against self-incrimination in refusing to speak with U.S. officials.

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">&#39;Do Not Track&#39; Internet dispute gets mediator</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 946</span>
FULL TEXTOver the past few months, an international effort to give consumers more control over the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collection</span> of their online <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> has devolved into acrimonious discussions, name-calling and witch hunts.The idea was to work out a global <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">standard</span> for &#39;&#39;Do Not Track,&#39;&#39; a computer browser setting that would allow Internet users to signal Web sites, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">advertising</span> networks and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> brokers that they did not want their browsing activities tracked for marketing purposes.But some industry executives involved in the negotiations have questioned the agenda of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> advocates, saying their efforts threaten to undermine an <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">advertising</span> ecosystem that fuels free online products and services. At the same time, some technology experts and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> advocates have accused industry executives of stalling and acting in bad faith.Into this rancorous battle steps a new mediator, Peter Swire, a professor of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> at Ohio State University and a former White House <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> official during the administration of President Bill Clinton. On Wednesday, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, the international consortium that has been trying to develop technical Do Not Track standards, said that Mr. Swire would take over as co-chairman of its Tracking Protection Working Group.While parties on both sides welcomed the move, many said they were doubtful that Mr. Swire could bring opponents to agreement, especially at a time when some industry groups were questioning whether the W3C was the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">right</span> forum.On one hand, industry executives have an interest in protecting &#39;&#39;behavioral&#39;&#39; ads, marketing pitches that use <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> about an individual&#39;s online activities to tailor ads to that person. On the other hand, consumer advocates argue that Internet users should be able to limit that kind of online surveillance.Mr. Swire, a former chief counselor for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> at the Office of Management and Budget, said he hoped to strike a balance that was palatable to both sides. He said he viewed a Do Not Track system as a kind of digital equivalent to the Do Not Call list, a national registry in the United States through which consumers may opt out of phone solicitations.&#39;&#39;People can choose not to have telemarketers call them during dinner. The simple idea is that users should have a choice over how their Internet browsing works as well,&#39;&#39; Mr. Swire said by telephone. But he added: &#39;&#39;The overarching theme is how to give users choice about their Internet experience while also funding a useful Internet.&#39;&#39;Still, Mr. Swire may not be able to overcome the bitterness that remains among the negotiating parties after months of public accusations, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">personal</span> attacks and recriminations.At an event at the White House this year, industry representatives publicly committed to incorporating and honoring a browser-based Do Not Track system under certain conditions. The conditions included a requirement that individual users would actively choose to turn on a don&#39;t-track-me setting. Industry groups also said that systems should still allow companies to <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">collect</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about users&#39; browsing activities for market research and product development purposes.But after months of wrangling with consumer advocates, industry representatives now say the W3C is not an appropriate forum for them to work out <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">policy</span> details, arguing that the group&#39;s expertise is more technical than practical.In an online discussion forum for the working group, for example, senior industry executives have suggested that respected technology experts are out of touch with commercial reality.&#39;&#39;The advocacy side of the group tends to lean toward absolutist terms and solutions,&#39;&#39; Shane Wiley, vice president for <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> governance at Yahoo, wrote in a message in September to Edward W. Felten, a professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey. &#39;&#39;The real world isn&#39;t that easy even if it feels that way in a classroom or a small lab.&#39;&#39;Then there are the technologists who say industry executives are playing down the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> risks of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> mining.&#39;&#39;For want of a better metaphor: you are the climate change skeptic of computer privacy,&#39;&#39; Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student in computer science and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> at Stanford University, wrote last month to Mr. Wiley of Yahoo. &#39;&#39;Unlike some of the more patient members of the group, I long ago ceased pretending you&#39;re negotiating in good faith.&#39;&#39;Now the industry has begun an effort to distance itself from the W3C process and promote its own self-regulatory program that allows consumers to decline targeted <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">advertising</span> by installing opt-out buttons from dozens of member companies.&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve seen the W3C falter,&#39;&#39; said Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group. &#39;&#39;So industry is redoubling its efforts to come up with a meaningful <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">standard</span> for browser controls.&#39;&#39;As the debate rages on, newer iterations of popular browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> Chrome have already installed Do Not Track settings for their users. But in the absence of accepted global standards for these systems, ad networks and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">data</span> brokers are not yet honoring the don&#39;t-track-me browser flags. Even the Microsoft and <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> ad services don&#39;t respond to such signals coming from their own browsers.Although Mr. Swire said he hoped to spur progress, for the moment Do Not Track browser settings have no more significance than emoticons.&#39;&#39;Do Not Track is a work in progress,&#39;&#39; Mr. Swire said. &#39;&#39;So is the Internet.&#39;&#39;

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">Top-ranked lawyer challenges Google</span>

<span class="ansi-blue-intense-fg ansi-bold">TOTAL WORDS: 984</span>
FULL TEXTRegulators in the United States have intensified their antitrust investigation of <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> by hiring a prominent litigator, sending a strong signal that they are prepared to take the Internet giant to court.The Federal Trade Commission is examining Google&#39;s immensely powerful and lucrative search technology, which directs users to hundreds of millions of online and offline destinations every day.The case has the potential to be the biggest showdown between regulators and Silicon Valley since the government took on Microsoft 14 years ago.Then, as now, the core question was whether power had been abused. The agency&#39;s current inquiry has focused on whether <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> has manipulated its search results, making it less likely that competing companies or products appear at the top of a results page.A spokeswoman for Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, declined to comment.F.T.C. officials cautioned that no decision had been made about whether to bring a formal case against Google. But the hiring of Beth A. Wilkinson on Thursday, a former Justice Department prosecutor who played a lead role in the conviction of the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, immediately catapulted the investigation to a new level. The agency has hired outside litigators only twice in the past decade.&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a watershed moment when you hire someone like this,&#39;&#39; said David P. Wales, a former F.T.C. official now in private practice with Jones Day. &#39;&#39;This shows <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> that if it doesn&#39;t give you the remedy you want, you&#39;re going to litigate.&#39;&#39;Several antitrust experts compared the hiring of Ms. Wilkinson - who has brought about 40 major cases in government and private practice and won them all - with the government&#39;s hiring of David A. Boies to represent it against Microsoft.&#39;&#39;It increases the likelihood that there will be a case,&#39;&#39; said Douglas F. Broder, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> partner at K&amp;amp;L Gates in New York and the author of several textbooks and articles on antitrust law.The Microsoft case in the late 1990s transformed the technology industry, reining in its most powerful company and allowing for the rise of new companies like Google. Now <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> wields the same sort of power that Microsoft once did and is under the same sort of scrutiny.It has been involved in one <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> controversy after another.Indeed, the announcement of the hiring of Ms. Wilkinson - made by the F.T.C.&#39;s chairman, Jon Leibowitz, at a meeting in San Francisco with reporters - eclipsed Google&#39;s formal response earlier Thursday to a fine by the Federal Communications Commission for obstructing a separate investigation.&#39;&#39;In an important case, you want to do a thorough investigation,&#39;&#39; Mr. Leibowitz said, calling Ms. Wilkinson &#39;&#39;a world-class litigator.&#39;&#39;Ms. Wilkinson is a partner at the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;amp; Garrison in Washington. She previously worked at Latham &amp;amp; Watkins, where she was co-chairwoman of the white-collar crime practice group. Her work at the F.T.C., which will be part-time, begins Monday.&#39;&#39;Technology is transforming our society,&#39;&#39; Ms. Wilkinson said in an interview. &#39;&#39;It affects people at every level. As a mother, I see it with my kids. As a professional, I see it affecting our work. And in society, it impacts privacy, competition, our interactions with other people - just about everything.&#39;&#39;She added: &#39;&#39;Working on the investigation will be a great challenge. I don&#39;t underestimate Google.&#39;&#39;No one else was underestimating it Thursday, either.Mr. Broder said antitrust cases charging abuse of a monopoly are difficult to prove.&#39;&#39;There is a lot of very complex economics involved,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It can be done. But <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> will undoubtedly bring to bear tremendous resources itself.&#39;&#39;Any decision about filing a suit is likely to be months away.&#39;&#39;Judgments about litigation are made at the end,&#39;&#39; said Richard Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission&#39;s Bureau of Competition. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not at the beginning, but we&#39;re not at the end either.&#39;&#39;The general issue underlying the investigation is whether <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> abuses its power in the market for Internet search. <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> controls about 66 percent of the U.S. search market, according to comScore, an Internet business research company. Bing, from Microsoft, accounts for about 15 percent of Internet searches, with Yahoo gathering 14 percent.Competitors have said that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> at times adjusts the <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">algorithm</span> that produces its search results to lower the likelihood that a link to a competitor or a potential competitor for its products appears near the top of the results.Questions have also been raised about whether <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> has done the same thing with the paid advertisements that appear on the right-hand side of a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> search page.While critics might say that <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> is manipulating its results to hinder competitors, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> might assert that it is tweaking its model to provide the best results to consumers.&#39;&#39;Google&#39;s power in my view comes not from its large market <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">share</span> but from the fact that consumers are unable to evaluate the product,&#39;&#39; said Mark R. Patterson, a <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">law</span> professor at Fordham University who focuses on antitrust law. &#39;&#39;It would be difficult to decide in many cases whether the results are exclusionary in a bad way or in a way that helps consumers.&#39;&#39;Google argues the latter and has said many times that &#39;&#39;competition is a click away.&#39;&#39; When the company announced in June that the F.T.C. had begun a review of its business, it noted that it made public much <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">information</span> about how its rankings work.Earlier Thursday, <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">Google</span> formally denied having obstructed an F.C.C. investigation into whether <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">privacy</span> <span class="ansi-yellow-bg">laws</span> had been violated in its Street View project, but the company agreed to pay a small fine anyway.
